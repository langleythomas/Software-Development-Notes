### 1.1.1. A Comment on Comments

- Comments are not evil. They are as necessary to programming as basic branching or looping constructs. Most modern
  languages have a tool akin to Javadoc that will parse properly formatted comments to automatically build an API
  document. This is a very good start, but not nearly enough. Inside your code should be explanations about what the
  code is supposed to be doing. Coding by the old adage, "If it was hard to write, it should be hard to read," does a
  disservice to your client, your employer, your colleagues, and your future self.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Make sure your comments clarify your code but do not obscure it. Sprinkle your code with relevant comments
  explaining what the code is supposed to accomplish. Your header comments should give any programmer enough
  information to use your code without having to read it, while your inline comments should assist the next developer
  in fixing or extending it.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.2. A Message to the Future

- It seems that programmers them think that since the problems they are struggling with are difficult, the solutions
  should be just as difficult for everyone (maybe even for themselves a few months after the code was written) to
  understand and maintain.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.3. Act with Prudence

- If you find yourself having to choose between "doing it right" and "doing it quick," it is often appealing to "do it
  quick" with the understanding that you'll come back and fix it later.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Technical debt is like a loan: you benefit from it in the short term, but you have to pay interest on it until it is
  fully paid off. Shortcuts in the code make it harder to add features or refactor your code. They are breeding grounds
  for defects and brittle test cases. The longer you leave it, the worse it gets. By the time you get around to
  undertaking the original fix, there may be a whole stack of not-quite-right design choices layered on top of the
  original problem, making the code much harder to refactor and correct.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- You must track technical debt and pay it back quickly, or things go rapidly downhill.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- If you schedule repayment of the debt in the next iteration, the cost will be minimal. Leaving the debt unpaid will
  accrue interest, and that interest should be tracked to make the cost visible.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.4. Apply Functional Programming Principles

- Functional programming has recently enjoyed renewed interest from the mainstream programming community. Part of the
  reason is because emergent properties of the functional paradigm are well positioned to address the challenges posed
  by our industry's shift toward multicore.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Mastery of the functional programming paradigm can greatly improve the quality of the code you write in other
  contexts.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- If you deeply understand and apply the functional paradigm, your designs will exhibit a much higher degree of
  referential transparency. Referential transparency is a very desirable property: it implies that functions
  consistently yield the same results given the same input, irrespective of where and when they are invoked. That is,
  function evaluation depends less - ideally, not at all - on the side effects of mutable state.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.5. Ask, "What Would the User Do?" (You Are Not the User)

- We all tend to assume that other people think like us. But they don't. Psychologists call this the false consensus
  bias. This bias explains why programmers have such a hard time putting themselves in the users' position. Users don't
  think like programmers.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- The best way to find out how a user thinks is to watch one. Ask a user to complete a task using a similar piece of
  software to what you're developing. Avoid tasks that are too specific, such as "Can you select these spreadsheet
  cells and enter a SUM formula below?" - there's a big clue in that question. Get the user to talk through their
  progress. Don't interrupt. Don't try to help. Keep asking yourself, "Why are they doing that?"
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- The first thing you'll notice is that users do a core of things similarly. They try to complete tasks in the same
  order - and they make the same mistakes in the same places. You should design around that core behaviour.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Users tend to muddle through. They'll find a way that works and stick with it, no matter how convoluted. It's better
  to provide one really obvious way of doing things than two or three shortcuts.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- You'll also find that there's a gap between what users say they want and what they actually do.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.6. Automate Your Coding Standard

- Well-formatted code doesn't earn you points with a customer that wants more functionality. Furthermore, following a
  coding standard can be quite a boring task if it isn't automated.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- One reason to format the code in a uniform way is so that nobody can "own" a piece of code just by formatting it in
  their private way. We may want to prevent developers from using certain anti-patterns in order to avoid some common
  bugs. In all, a coding standard should make it easier to work in the project, and maintain development speed from the
  beginning to the end. It follows, then, that everybody should agree on the coding standard, too - it does not help if
  one developer uses three spaces to indent code, and another uses four.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- There exists a wealth of tools that can be used to produce code quality reports and to document and maintain the
  coding standard, but that isn't the whole solution. It should be automated and enforced where possible. Here are a
  few examples:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Make sure code formatting is part of the build process, so that everybody runs it automatically every time they
    compile the code.

  - Use static code analysis tools to scan the code for unwanted anti-patterns. If any are found, break the build.

  - Learn to configure those tools so that you can scan for your own, project-specific anti-patterns.

  - Do not only measure test coverage, but automatically check the results, too. Again, break the build if test
    coverage is too low.

- Try to do this for everything that you consider important. You won't be able to automate everything you really care
  about. As for the things that you can't automatically flag or fix, consider them a set of guidelines supplementary to
  the coding standard that is automated, but accept that you and your colleagues may not follow them as diligently.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- The coding standard should be dynamic rather than static. As the project evolves, the needs of the project change,
  and what may have seemed smart in the beginning isn't necessarily smart a few months later.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.7. Beauty Is in Simplicity

- Beautiful code is simple code. Each individual part is kept simple with simple responsibilities and simple
  relationships with the other parts of the system. This is the way we can keep our systems maintainable over time,
  with clean, simple, testable code, ensuring a high speed of development throughout the lifetime of the system.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.8. Before You Refactor

- The best approach for restructuring starts by taking stock of the existing codebase and the tests written against
  that code. This will help you understand the strengths and weaknesses of the code as it currently stands, so you can
  ensure that you retain the strong points while avoiding the mistakes.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Avoid the temptation to rewrite everything. It is best to reuse as much code as possible. No matter how ugly the code
  is, it has already been tested, reviewed, etc. Throwing away the old code - especially if it was in production -
  means that you are throwing away months (or years) of tested, battle-hardened code that may have had certain
  workarounds and bug fixes you aren't aware of.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Many incremental changes are better than one massive change. Incremental changes allows you to gauge the impact on
  the system more easily through feedback, such as from tests.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- After each development iteration, it is important to ensure that the existing tests pass. Add new tests if the
  existing tests are not sufficient to cover the changes you made. Do not throw away the tests from the old code
  without due consideration.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Personal preferences and ego shouldn't get in the way. If something isn't broken, why fix it? That the style or the
  structure of the code does not meet your personal preference is not a valid reason for restructuring. Thinking you
  could do a better job than the previous programmer is not a valid reason, either.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- New technology is an insufficient reason to refactor. One of the worst reasons to refactor is because the current
  code is way behind all the cool technology we have today, and we believe that a new language or framework can do
  things a lot more elegantly.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Remember that humans make mistakes. Restructuring will not always guarantee that the new code will be better - or
  even as good as - the previous attempt.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.9. Beware the Share

- Before reducing the number of lines of code, make sure you aren't increasing the number of dependencies, or the
  complexity of existing dependencies.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.10. Check Your Code First Before Looking to Blame Others

- Any issues in code are most likely caused by your changes.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.11. Choose Your Tools with Care

- Start only using the tools that are absolutely necessary.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.12. Code in the Language of the Domain

- The following code is not very clear. It seems to be getting an ID from a trader object; using that to get a map out
  of a, well, map-of-maps, apparently; and then seeing if another ID from a portfolio object exists in the inner map.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  ```java
  if (portfolioIdsByTraderId.get(trader.getId()).containsKey(portfolio.getId())) {
    ...
  }

  Map<int, Map<int, int>> portfolioIdsByTraderId;
  ```

- You don't need to know how a trader knows. Perhaps there is one of these maps-of-maps tucked away somewhere inside.
  But that's the trader's business, not yours.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  ```java
  if (trader.canView(portfolio)) {
    ...
  }
  ```

- Making domain concepts explicit in your code means other programmers can gather the intent of the code much more
  easily than by trying to retrofit an algorithm into what they understand about a domain. It also means that when the
  domain model evolves - which it will, as your understanding of the domain grows - you are in a good position to
  evolve the code. Coupled with good encapsulation, the chances are good that the rule will exist in only one place,
  and that you can change it without any of the dependent code being any the wiser.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.13. Code is Design

- The demand for quality, validated designs exceeds our ability to create them. There is a strong pressure to use
  incomplete design.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.14. Code Layout Matters

- We all spend much more of our programming time navigating and reading code - finding where to make a change - than
  actually typing, so that's what we optimise for. Here are three such optimisations:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Compact Format**:

    - The more you can get on a screen, the more you can see without breaking context by scrolling or switching files,
      which means you can keep less state in your head.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - Long procedure comments and lots of whitespace made sense for eight-character names and line printers, but now
      with a modern IDE that does syntax colouring and cross linking.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - The layout should help understand the code, but no more than that.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Easy to Scan**:

    - People are really good at visual pattern matching, so it can help by making everything that isn't directly
      relevant to the domain - all the "accidental complexity" that comes with most commercial languages - fade into
      the background by standardising it.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Expressive Layout**:

    - It takes time to find the right names so that our code expresses as clearly as possible what it does, rather than
      just listing the steps. The code's layout is part of this expressiveness, too.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - A formatter cannot understand the programmer's intentions, it's more important that the line breaks and groupings
      reflect the intention of the code, not just the syntax of the language.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.15. Code Reviews

- Instead of simply correcting mistakes in code, the purpose of code reviews should be to share knowledge and establish
  common coding guidelines. Sharing your code with other programmers enables collective code ownership. Instead of
  looking for errors, you should review the code by trying to learn and understand it.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Be gentle during code reviews. Ensure that comments are constructive, not caustic. Introduce different roles for the
  review meeting to avoid having organisational seniority among team members affect the code review. Examples of roles
  could include having one reviewer focus on documentation, another on exceptions, and a third to look at the
  functionality. This approach helps to spread the review burden across the team members.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Involve newbies in code reviews. They may be inexperienced, but their fresh university knowledge can provide a
  different perspective. Involve experts for their experience and knowledge. They will identify error-prone code faster
  and with more accuracy. Code reviews will flow more easily if the team has coding conventions that are checked by
  tools. That way, code formatting will never be discussed during the code review meeting.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.16. Coding with Reason

- The underlying approach is to divide all the code under consideration into short sections - from a single line, such
  as a function call, to blocks of less than 10 lines.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Striving for sections to be as independent of one another as possible simplifies reasoning and is indispensable when
  these sections are to be modified.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Many of the coding practices that are well known and considered "good" make reasoning easier. Hence, just by
  intending to reason about your code, you already start moving toward a better style and structure. Unsurprisingly,
  most of these practices can be checked by static code analysers:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Avoid using goto statements, as they make remote sections highly interdependent.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Avoid using modifiable global variables, as they make all sections that use them dependent.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Each variable should have the smallest possible scope. For example, a local object can be declared right before its
    first usage.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Make objects immutable whenever relevant.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Make the code readable by using spacing, both horizontal and vertical - e.g., aligning related structures and using
    an empty line to separate two sections.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Make the code self-documenting by choosing descriptive (but relatively short) names for objects, types, functions,
    etc.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - If you need a nested section, make it a function.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Make your functions short and focused on a single task. The old 24-line limit still applies. Although screen size
    and resolution have changed, nothing has changed in human cognition since the 1960s.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Functions should have few parameters (four is a good upper bound). This does not restrict the data communicated to
    functions: grouping related parameters into a single object localises object invariants, which simplifies reasoning
    with respect to their coherence and consistency.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - More generally, each unit of code, from a block to a library, should have a narrow interface. Less communication
    reduces the reasoning required. This means that getters that return internal state are a liability - don't ask an
    object for information to work with. Instead, ask the object to do the work with the information it already has. In
    other words, encapsulation is all - and only - about narrow interfaces.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - In order to preserve class invariants, usage of setters should be discouraged. Setters tend to allow invariants
    that govern an object's state to be broken.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.17. Comment Only What the Code Cannot Say

- When code is ill-formed, compilers, interpreters, and other tools will be sure to object. If the code is in some way
  functionally incorrect, reviews, static analysis, tests, and day-to-day use in a production environment will flush
  most bugs out, but comments often litter and survive in a codebase in a way that coding errors never could. They
  provide a constant source of distraction and misinformation, a subtle but constant distraction on a programmer's
  thinking.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Comments that are not technically wrong, but add no value to the code are noise. Comments that parrot the code offer
  nothing extra to the reader - stating something once in code and again in natural language does not make it any truer
  or more real. Commented-out code is not executable code, so it has no useful effect for either reader or runtime. It
  also becomes stale very quickly. Version-related comments and commented-out code try to address questions of
  versioning and history. These questions have already been answered (far more effectively) by version control tools.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- A prevalence of noisy comments and incorrect comments in a codebase encourages programmers to ignore all comments,
  either by skipping past them or by taking active measures to hide them.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Comments should say something code does not and cannot say. A comment explaining what a piece of code should already
  say is an invitation to change code structure or coding conventions so the code speaks for itself. Instead of
  compensating for poor method or class names, rename them. Instead of commenting sections in long functions, extract
  smaller functions whose names capture the former sections' intent. Try to express as much as possible through code.
  Any shortfall between what you can express in code and what you would like to express in total becomes a plausible
  candidate for a useful comment.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Comment what the code cannot say, not simply what it does not say.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.18. Continuous Learning

- Some employers are generous enough to provide training to broaden your skill set. Others may not be able to spare the
  time or money for any training at all. To play it safe, you need to take responsibility for your own education.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- A list of ways to help you keep learning:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Read books, magazines, blogs, Twitter feeds, and websites, mailing lists, newsgroups, etc.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - If you really want to get immersed in a technology, get hands on - write some code.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Always try to work with a mentor, as being the top guy can hinder your education. Although you can learn something
    from anybody, you can learn a whole lot more from someone smarter or more experienced than you. If you can't find a
    mentor, consider moving on.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Use virtual mentors. Find authors and developers on the Web who you really like and read everything (or at least
    some of what) they write.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Get to know the frameworks and libraries you use. Knowing how something works makes you know how to use it better.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Whenever you make a mistake, fix a bug, or run into a problem, try to really understand what happened. It's likely
    that someone else ran into the same problem and posted it on the Web.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - A good way to learn something is to teach or speak about it. When people are going to listen to you and ask you
    questions, you'll be highly motivated to learn.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Go to conferences.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Long commute? Listen to podcasts.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Ever run a static analysis tool over the codebase or look at the warnings in your IDE? Understand what they're
    reporting and why.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Learn a new language every year. At least learn a new technology or tool. Branching out gives you new ideas you can
    use in your current technology stack.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Not everything you learn has to be about technology. Learn the domain you're working in so you can better
    understand the requirements and help solve the business problem. Learning how to be more productive - how to work
    better - is another good option.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.19. Convenience is Not an -ility

- Good API design comes from the following "insights":
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Don't require API users make two separate calls to do one things.

  - Why make another method if it's almost the same as an existing method? Just add a simple `switch`.

- The following is a bad example of a method call to an API:

  ```java
  parser.processNodes(text, false);
  ```

- The following is a better example of a method call to an API:

  ```java
  parser.processNodes("example_text_file", "txt");
  ```

- APIs are supposed to hide underlying complexity, so we can realistically expect good API design to require some
  effort. A single large method could certainly be more convenient to write than a well-thought-out set of operations,
  but would it be easier to use?
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.20. Deploy Early and Often

- The installation/deployment process is the first thing that the customer sees, and a simple one is the first step to
  having a reliable (or, at least, easy to debug) production environment. The deployed software is what the customer
  will use. By not ensuring that the deployment sets up the application correctly, you'll raise questions with your
  customers before they get to use your software thoroughly.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Starting your project with an installation process will give you time to evolve the process as you move through the
  product development cycle, and the chance to make changes to the application code to make the installation easier.
  Running and testing the installation process on a clean environment periodically also provides a check that you have
  not made assumptions in the code that rely on the development or test environments.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Putting deployment last means that the deployment process may need to be more complicated to work around assumptions
  in the code. What seemed a great idea in an IDE, where you have full control over an environment, might make for a
  much more complicated deployment process. It is better to know all the trade-offs sooner rather than later.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.21. Distinguish Business Exceptions from Technical

- There are basically two reasons that things go wrong at runtime: technical problems that prevent us from using the
  application and business logic that prevents us from misusing the application.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- An unresolvable technical problem can occur when there is a programming error. For example, if you try to access
  element 83 from an array of size 17, then the program is clearly off track, and some exception should result. The
  subtler version is calling some library code with inappropriate arguments, causing the same situation on the inside
  of the library.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Mixing technical exceptions and business exceptions in the same hierarchy blurs the distinction and confuses the
  caller about what the method contract is, what conditions it is required to ensure before calling, and what
  situations it is supposed to handle. Separating the cases gives clarity and increases the chances that technical
  exceptions will be handled by some application framework, while the business domain exceptions actually are
  considered and handled by the client code.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.22. Do Lots of Deliberate Practice

- You do deliberate practice to improve your ability to perform a task. It's about skill and technique. Deliberate
  practice means repetition. It means performing the task with the aim of increasing your mastery of one or more
  aspects of the task.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- The principal aim of paid development is to finish a product, whereas the principal aim of deliberate practice is to
  improve your performance. They are not the same. Deliberate practice is about learning - learning that changes you,
  learning that changes your behaviour.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.23. Domain-Specific Languages

- Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) are a specific domain has a specialised vocabulary to describe the things that are
  particular to that domain.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- In the world of software, DSLs are about executable expressions in a language specific to a domain, employing a
  limited vocabulary and grammar that is readable, understandable, and - hopefully - writeable by domain experts.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- DSLs are commonly classified as either internal or external:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Internal DSLs**:

    - Written in a general-purpose programming language whose syntax has been bent to look much more like natural
      language. This is easier for languages that offer more syntactic sugar and formatting possibilities (e.g., Ruby
      and Scala) than it is for others that do not (e.g., Java).
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - Most internal DSLs wrap existing APIs, libraries, or business code and provide a wrapper for less mind-bending
      access to the functionality.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - Depending on the implementation and the domain, they are used to build data structures, define dependencies, run
      processes or tasks, communicate with other systems, or validate user input.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **External DSLs**:

    - Are textual or graphical expressions of the language - although textual DSLs tend to be more common than
      graphical ones. Textual expressions can be processed by a toolchain that includes a lexer, parser, model
      transformer, generators, and any other type of post-processing. External DSLs are mostly read into internal
      models that form the basis for further processing.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - Defining external DSLs as XML dialects is also quite common, although readability is often an issue - especially
      for non-technical readers.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- You must always take the target audience of your DSL into account. Are they developers, managers, business
  customers, or end users? You have to adapt the technical level of the language, the available tools, syntax help
  (e.g., IntelliSense), early validation, visualisation, and representation to the intended audience.

### 1.1.24. Don't Be Afraid to Break Things

- Don't be afraid of your code. Who cares if something gets temporarily broken while you move things around? A
  paralysing fear of change is what could have gotten a project into this state to begin with. Investing the time to
  refactor will pay for itself several times over the lifecycle of your project. An added benefit is that your team's
  experience dealing with the sick system makes you all experts in knowing how it should work.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Redefine internal interfaces, restructure modules, refactor copy–pasted code, and simplify your design by reducing
  dependencies. You can significantly reduce code complexity by eliminating corner cases, which often result from
  improperly coupled features. Slowly transition the old structure into the new one, testing along the way. Trying to
  accomplish a large refactor in "one big shebang" will cause enough problems to make you consider abandoning the whole
  effort midway through.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.25. Don't Be Cute with Your Test Data

- When writing any text in your code - whether comments, logging, dialogues, or test data - always ask yourself how it
  will look if it becomes public.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.26. Don't Ignore That Error

- If you ignore an error, turn a blind eye, and pretend that nothing has gone wrong, you run great risks. Deal with
  problems at the earliest opportunity. Keep a short account.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Not handling errors leads to:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Brittle code**:

    - Code that's filled with exciting, hard-to-find bugs.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Insecure code**:

    - Crackers often exploit poor error handling to break into software systems.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Poor structure**:

    - If there are errors from your code that are tedious to deal with continually, you probably have a poor interface.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - Express it so that the errors are less intrusive and their handling is less onerous.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Just as you should check all potential errors in your code, you need to expose all potentially erroneous conditions
  in your interfaces. Do not hide them, pretending that your services will always work.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.27. Don't Just Learn the Language, Understand Its Culture

- It takes more than just learning the syntax to learn a language: you need to understand its culture.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Once you've learned the ropes of a new language, you'll be surprised how you'll start using languages you already
  know in new ways. You'll also get a better understanding of design patterns by moving between different languages. C
  programmers find that C# and Java have commoditised the iterator pattern. In Ruby and other dynamic languages, you
  might still use a visitor, but your implementation won't look like the example from the Gang of Four book.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.28. Don't Nail Your Program into the Upright Position

- Handle all exceptions gracefully. Users should never have to see exception reports.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.29. Don't Rely on "Magic Happens Here"

- The persistent vision that software development can be simplified by removing programming is, to the programmer who
  understands what is involved, obviously naïve. But the mental process that leads to this mistake is part of human
  nature, and programmers are just as prone to making it as everyone else.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- When you aren't actively involved in things, there is an unconscious tendency to assume that they are simple and
  happen "by magic." While the magic continues to happen, all is well. But when - it is usually "when" and not "if " -
  the magic stops, the project is in trouble.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- You don't have to understand all the magic that makes your project work, but it doesn't hurt to understand some of it
  or to appreciate someone who understands the bits you don't. Most importantly, make sure that when the magic stops,
  it can be started again.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.30. Don't Repeat Yourself

- The developer who learns to recognise duplication, and understands how to eliminate it through appropriate practice
  and proper abstraction, can produce much cleaner code than one who continuously infects the application with
  unnecessary repetition.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

#### 1.1.30.1. Duplication is Waste

- Every line of code that goes into an application must be maintained, and is a potential source of future bugs.
  Duplication needlessly bloats the codebase, resulting in more opportunities for bugs and adding accidental complexity
  to the system. The bloat that duplication adds to the system also makes it more difficult for developers working with
  the system to fully understand the entire system, or to be certain that changes made in one location do not also need
  to be made in other places that duplicate the logic they are working on.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

#### 1.1.30.2. Repetition in Process Calls for Automation

- Manual testing is slow, error-prone, and difficult to repeat, so automated test suites should be used where possible.
  Integrating software can be time consuming and error-prone if done manually, so a build process should be run as
  frequently as possible, ideally with every check-in. Wherever painful manual processes exist that can be automated,
  they should be automated and standardised. The goal is to ensure that there is only one way of accomplishing the
  task, and it is as painless as possible.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

#### 1.1.30.3. Repetition in Logic Calls for Abstraction

- Repetition in logic can take many forms. Copy-and-paste `if-then` or `switch-case` logic is among the easiest to
  detect and correct. Many design patterns have the explicit goal of reducing or eliminating duplication in logic
  within an application. If an object typically requires several things to happen before it can be used, this can be
  accomplished with an Abstract Factory or a Factory Method pattern. If an object has many possible variations in its
  behaviour, these behaviours can be injected using the Strategy pattern rather than large `if-then` structures. In
  fact, the formulation of design patterns themselves is an attempt to reduce the duplication of effort required to
  solve common problems and discuss such solutions.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

#### 1.1.30.4. A Matter of Principle

- When followed with regard to structure, logic, process, and function, the DRY principle provides fundamental guidance
  to software developers and aids the creation of simpler, more maintainable, higher-quality applications. While there
  are scenarios where repetition can be necessary to meet performance or other requirements (e.g., data denormalisation
  in a database), it should be used only where it directly addresses an actual rather than an imagined problem.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.31. Don't Touch That Code

- A developer should not have access to a staging server.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- In most web-based development environments, the architecture can be broken down like this:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Local development and unit testing on the developer's machine
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Development server where manual or automated integration testing is done
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Staging server where the QA team and the users do acceptance testing
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Production server
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Under no circumstances - ever, at all - should a developer have access to a production server. If there is a problem,
  your support staff should either fix it or request that you fix it. After it's checked into SCC, they will roll a
  patch from there.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.32. Encapsulate Behaviour, Not Just State

- Modules and packages address the larger-scale needs for encapsulation, while classes, subroutines, and functions
  address the more fine-grained aspects of the matter.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- A class with a single 3,000-line main method, or a class with only set and get methods for its primitive attributes
  demonstrate that the developers involved have not fully understood object-oriented thinking, having failed to take
  advantage of the power of objects as modelling constructs.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- An object encapsulates both state and behaviour, where the behaviour is defined by the actual state. Consider a
  `Door` object. It has four states: closed, open, closing, opening. It provides two operations: open and close.
  Depending on the state, the open and close operations will behave differently. This inherent property of an object
  makes the design process conceptually simple. It boils down to two simple tasks: allocation and delegation of
  responsibility to the different objects including the inter-object interaction protocols.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Let's say we have three classes: `Customer`, `Order`, and `Item`. A `Customer` object is the natural placeholder for
  the credit limit and credit validation rules. An `Order` object knows about its associated `Customer`, and its
  `addItem` operation delegates the actual credit check by calling `customer.validateCredit(item.price())`. If the
  postcondition for the method fails, an exception can be thrown and the purchase aborted.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Less experienced object-oriented developers might decide to wrap all the business rules into an object very often
  referred to as `OrderManager` or `OrderService`. In these designs, `Order`, `Customer`, and `Item` are treated as
  little more than record types. All logic is factored out of the classes and tied together in one large, procedural
  method with a lot of internal if-then-else constructs. These methods are easily broken and are almost impossible to
  maintain because the encapsulation is broken.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.33. Floating-Point Numbers Aren't Real

- You shouldn't use floating-point numbers for financial applications - that's what decimal classes in languages like
  Python and C# are for. Floating-point numbers are intended for efficient scientific computation. But efficiency is
  worthless without accuracy, so remember the source of rounding errors, and code accordingly.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.34. Fulfil Your Ambitions with Open Source

- Open source provides enormous opportunities for the motivated programmer. First, you get to see how someone else
  would implement a solution that interests you - you can learn a lot by reading other people's source code. Second,
  you get to contribute your own code and ideas to the project - not every brilliant idea you have will be accepted,
  but some might, and you'll learn something new just by working on solutions and contributing code. Third, you'll meet
  great people with the same passion for the type of software that you have - these open source friendships can last a
  lifetime. Fourth, assuming you are a competent contributor, you'll be able to add real-world experience in the
  technology that actually interests you.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Getting started with open source is pretty easy. There is a wealth of documentation out there on the tools you'll
  need (source code management, editors, programming languages, build systems, etc.). Find the project you want to work
  on first and learn about the tools that project uses. The documentation on projects themselves will be light in most
  cases, but this perhaps matters less because the best way to learn is to investigate the code yourself. If you want
  to get involved, you could offer to help out with the documentation. Or you could start by volunteering to write test
  code. While that may not sound exciting, the truth is you learn much faster by writing test code for other people's
  software than almost any other activity in software. Write test code, really good test code. Find bugs, suggest
  fixes, make friends, work on software you like, and fulfil your software development ambitions.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.35. Hard Work Does Not Pay Off

- Professional programming is usually not like running hard for a few kilometres, where the goal can be seen at the end
  of a paved road. Most software projects are more like a long orienteering marathon. In the dark. With only a sketchy
  map as guidance. If you just set off in one direction, running as fast as you can, you might impress some, but you
  are not likely to succeed. You need to keep a sustainable pace, and you need to adjust the course when you learn more
  about where you are and where you are heading.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Be focused on the project, contribute as much as you can by finding smart solutions, improve your skills, reflect on
  what you are doing, and adapt your behaviour.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- As a professional programmer, you should know that trying to be focused and "productive" 60 hours a week is not a
  sensible thing to do. Act like a professional: prepare, effect, observe, reflect, and change.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.36. How to Use a Bug Tracker

- A good bug report needs to convey three things:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - How to reproduce the bug, as precisely as possible, and how often this will make the bug appear.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - What should have happened, at least in your opinion.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - What actually happened, or at least as much information as you have recorded.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- The amount and quality of information reported in a bug says as much about the reporter as it does about the bug.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Bugs are like a conversation, with all the history right there in front of everyone. Don't blame others or deny the
  bug's very existence. Instead, ask for more information or consider what you could have missed.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.37. Improve Code by Removing It

- Some reasons why unnecessary code may be added to a project:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Write code because it adds value, not because it amuses you.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - If you don't need code right now, don't write it right now.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - It always takes longer to write and to maintain extra code. A small, extra bit of code snowballs over time into a
    large piece of work that needs maintenance.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Programmers do not set system requirements; the customer does. A programmer should not add code for non-existent
    or non-documented requirements, without a very good reason.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.38. Interprocess Communication Affects Application Response Time

- Response time is critical to software usability. Few things are as frustrating as waiting for some software system to
  respond, especially when our interaction with the software involves repeated cycles of stimulus and response.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Much of modern performance management literature still focuses on data structures and algorithms, issues that can
  make a difference in some cases but are far less likely to dominate performance in modern multi-tier enterprise
  applications.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Each remote interprocess communication contributes some non-negligible latency to the overall response time, and
  these individual contributions add up, especially when they are incurred in sequence.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- There are a few relatively obvious and well-known strategies for reducing the number of remote interprocess
  communications per stimulus. One strategy is to apply the principle of parsimony, optimising the interface between
  processes so that exactly the right data for the purpose at hand is exchanged with the minimum amount of interaction.
  Another strategy is to parallelise the interprocess communications where possible, so that the overall response time
  becomes driven mainly by the longest-latency IPC. A third strategy is to cache the results of previous IPCs, so that
  future IPCs may be avoided by hitting local cache instead.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- When you're designing an application, be mindful of the number of interprocess communications in response to each
  stimulus. When analysing applications that suffer from poor performance, you may find IPC-to-stimulus ratios of
  thousands-to-one. Reducing this ratio, whether by caching or parallelising or some other technique, will pay off much
  more than changing data structure choice or tweaking a sorting algorithm.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.39. Keep the Build Clean

- When starting a new project from scratch, there are no warnings, no clutter, no problems. But as the codebase grows,
  if you don't pay attention, the clutter, the cruft, the warnings, and the problems can start piling up. When there's
  a lot of noise, it's much harder to find the warning that you really want to read among the hundreds of warnings you
  don't care about.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- To make warnings useful again, try to use a zero-tolerance policy for warnings from the build. Even if the warning
  isn't important, deal with it. If it's not critical but still relevant, fix it.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.40. Know How to Use Command-Line Tools

- By working with command-line build tools, you will learn a lot more about what the tools are doing when your project
  is being built. Experimenting with the many command-line options for these tools is a valuable educational
  experience.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- There are some tasks that can be performed more easily or more efficiently with command-line tools than with an IDE.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Command-line tools inherently support scripting, which allows for the automation of tasks such as producing scheduled
  daily builds, creating multiple versions of a project, and running test suites.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.41. Know Well More Than Two Programming Languages

- Every programmer starts with one programming language. That language has a dominating effect on the way that
  programmer thinks about software.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- A programmer who learns a second language will be challenged, especially if that language has a different
  computational model than the first.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- We can enumerate a number of paradigms of computation: procedural, object-oriented, functional, logic, data flow,
  etc. Moving among these paradigms creates the greatest challenges.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- The consequence of all this is that it behoves every programmer to be well skilled in programming in at least two
  different paradigms, and ideally at least the aforementioned five.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Programmers should always be interested in learning new languages, preferably from an unfamiliar paradigm. Even if
  their day job always uses the same programming language, the increased sophistication of use of that language when a
  person can cross-fertilise from other paradigms should not be underestimated.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.42. Know Your IDE

- Modern IDEs do not require us to invest effort to learn how to use them. Modern IDEs have a very gradual learning
  curve, which can have the effect that we never progress beyond the most basic usage of the tool.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.43. Know Your Limits

- You only have so much time and money to do your work, including the time and money needed to keep your knowledge,
  skills, and tools up to date. You can only work so hard, so fast, so smart, and so long. Your tools are only so
  powerful. Your target machines are only so powerful. So you have to respect the limits of your resources.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- How to respect those limits? Know yourself, know your people, know your budgets, and know your stuff. Especially, as
  a software engineer, know the space and time complexity of your data structures and algorithms, and the architecture
  and performance characteristics of your systems. Your job is to create an optimal marriage of software and systems.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.44. Know Your Next Commit

- Know your next commit. If you cannot finish, throw away your changes, then define a new task you believe in with the
  insights you have gained. Do speculative experimentation whenever needed, but do not let yourself slip into
  speculative mode without noticing. Do not commit guesswork into your repository.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.45. Large, Interconnected Data Belongs to a Database

- If your application is going to handle a large, persistent, interconnected set of data elements, don't hesitate to
  store it in a relational database.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- In the past, RDBMSes (Relational Database Systems) used to be expensive, scarce, complex, and unwieldy beasts. This
  is no longer the case. Nowadays, RDBMSes are easy to find - it is likely that the system you're using already has one
  or two installed. Some very capable RDBMSes, like MySQL and PostgreSQL, are available as open source software, so
  cost of purchase is no longer an issue. Even better, so-called embedded database systems can be linked as libraries
  directly into your application, requiring almost no setup or management - two notable open source ones are SQLite and
  HSQLDB (HyperSQL DataBase). These systems are extremely efficient.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Benefits of RDBMSes:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - A single SQL command can perform complex data changes. For one-off modifications - say, a change in the way you
    organise your persistent data - you don't even need to write code: just fire up the database's direct SQL
    interface.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - You can describe consistency constraints on your data in a declarative way, avoiding the risk of the dangling
    pointers you get if you forget to update your data in an edge case. For example, you can specify that if a user is
    deleted, then the messages sent by that user should be removed as well.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - After you've stored your properly normalised data in the database, it's easy to extract facts efficiently with a
    readable SQL query; there's no need to write any complex code.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - You can also create efficient links between the entities stored in the database any time you want, simply by
    creating an index. There is no need to perform expensive and extensive refactoring of class fields.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Coding around a database allows multiple applications to access your data in a safe way. This makes it easy to
    upgrade your application for concurrent use and also to code each part of your application using the most
    appropriate language and platform.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Keep in mind that the RDBMSes will sweat hard to optimise your SQL commands, allowing you to concentrate on your
  application's functionality rather than on algorithmic tuning.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.46. Learn Foreign Languages

- Beyond communication with machine, self, and peers, a project has many stakeholders, most with a different or no
  technical background. You need to understand them and their concerns. This is almost impossible if you cannot speak
  their language - the language of their world, their domain. While you might think a conversation with them went well,
  they probably didn't.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- All these domain-specific languages need to be mastered by someone in the project - ideally, the programmers.
  Programmers are ultimately responsible for bringing the ideas to life via a computer.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.47. Learn to Estimate

- As a programmer, you need to be able to provide estimates to your managers, colleagues, and users for the tasks you
  need to perform, so that they will have a reasonably accurate idea of the time, costs, technology, and other
  resources needed to achieve their goals.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- To be able to estimate well, it is obviously important to learn some estimation techniques. First of all, however, it
  is fundamental to learn what estimates are, and what they should be used for - as strange as it may seem, many
  developers and managers don't really know this.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- In order to estimate accurately, we need three definitions - estimate, target, and commitment:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Estimate**:

    - An estimate is an approximate calculation or judgment of the value, number, quantity, or extent of something.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - This definition implies that an estimate is a factual measure based on hard data and previous experience - hopes
      and wishes must be ignored when calculating it.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - The definition also implies that, being approximate, an estimate cannot be precise, e.g., a development task
      cannot be estimated to last 234.14 days.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Target**:

    - A statement of a desirable business objective, e.g., "The system must support at least 400 concurrent users."
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Commitment**:

    - A promise to deliver specified functionality at a certain level of quality by a certain date or event, e.g., "The
      search functionality will be available in the next release of the product."
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Estimates, targets, and commitments are independent from one another, but targets and commitments should be based on
  sound estimates.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.48. Learn to Say, "Hello, World"

- It can often help to create a small standalone project to test a change without any external dependencies.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.49. Let Your Project to Speak for Itself

- You need to give your project a voice. This can be done by email or instant messaging, informing the developers about
  the latest decline or improvement in the metrics in your project, such as code coverage, installation times, etc.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.50. Make Interfaces Easy to Use Correct and Hard to Use Incorrectly

- One of the most common tasks in software development is interface specification. Interfaces occur at the highest
  level of abstraction (user interfaces), at the lowest (function interfaces), and at levels in between (class
  interfaces, library interfaces, etc.). Regardless of whether you work with end users to specify how they'll interact
  with a system, collaborate with developers to specify an API, or declare functions private to a class, interface
  design is an important part of your job. If you do it well, your interfaces will be a pleasure to use and will boost
  others' productivity. If you do it poorly, your interfaces will be a source of frustration and errors.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Good interfaces are:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Easy to Use Correctly**:

    - People using a well-designed interface almost always use the interface correctly, because that's the path of
      least resistance. In a GUI, they almost always click on the right icon, button, or menu entry, because it's the
      obvious and easy thing to do. In an API, they almost always pass the correct parameters with the correct values,
      because that's what's most natural. With interfaces that are easy to use correctly, things just work.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Hard to Use Incorrectly**:

    - Good interfaces anticipate mistakes people might make, and make them difficult - ideally, impossible - to commit.
      A GUI might disable or remove commands that make no sense in the current context, for example, or an API might
      eliminate argument-ordering problems by allowing parameters to be passed in any order.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- A good way to design interfaces that are easy to use correctly is to exercise them before they exist.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Making interfaces hard to use incorrectly requires two things. First, you must anticipate errors users might make and
  find ways to prevent them. Second, you must observe how an interface is misused during early release and modify the
  interface to prevent such errors.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- If users keep wanting to undo an irrevocable action, try to make the action revocable. If they keep passing the wrong
  value to an API, do your best to modify the API to take the values that users want to pass.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Remember that interfaces exist for the convenience of their users, not their implementers.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.51. Make the Invisible More Visible

- Software and the process of developing it can be mostly invisible:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Source code has no innate presence, no innate behaviour, and doesn't obey the laws of physics. It's visible when
    you load it into an editor, but close the editor and it's gone.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - A running application has presence and behaviour, but reveals nothing of the source code it was built from.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - If you're 90% done and endlessly stuck trying to debug your way through the last 10%, then you're not 90% done, are
    you? Fixing bugs is not making progress. You aren't paid to debug. Debugging is waste. It's good to make waste more
    visible so you can see it for what it is and start thinking about trying not to create it in the first place.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - If your project is apparently on track, and one week later it's six months late, you have problems - the biggest of
    which is probably not that it's six months late, but the invisibility force fields powerful enough to hide six
    months of lateness.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Invisibility can be dangerous. You think more clearly when you have something concrete to tie your thinking to. You
  manage things better when you can see them and see them constantly changing:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Writing unit tests provides evidence about how easy the code unit is to unit test. It helps reveal the presence (or
    absence) of developmental qualities you'd like the code to exhibit, such as low coupling and high cohesion.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Running unit tests provides evidence about the code's behaviour. It helps reveal the presence (or absence) of
    runtime qualities you'd like the application to exhibit, such as robustness and correctness.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Tracking work can tickets can be used to show that work's status as `Not Started`, `In Progress`, or `Done` without
    reference to a hidden project management tool and without having to chase programmers for fictional status reports.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Doing incremental development increases the visibility of development progress (or lack of it) by increasing the
    frequency of development evidence.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- It's best to develop software with plenty of regular visible evidence. Visibility gives confidence that progress is
  genuine and not an illusion, deliberate and not unintentional, repeatable and not accidental.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.52. Message Passing Leads to Better Scalability in Parallel Systems

- Concurrency - and especially parallelism, a special subset of concurrency - is hard, that only the very best can ever
  hope to get it right, and even they get it wrong.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Almost all the problems of concurrency that people go on and on about relate to the use of shared mutable memory:
  race conditions, deadlock, livelock, etc. The answer seems obvious: either forgo concurrency or eschew shared memory.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Forgoing concurrency is almost certainly not an option. Computers have more and more cores on an almost quarterly
  basis, so harnessing true parallelism becomes more and more important. We can no longer rely on ever-increasing
  processor clock speeds to improve application performance. So we can eschew shared memory.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Instead of using threads and shared memory as our programming model, we can use processes and message passing.
  Process here just means a protected independent state with executing code, not necessarily an operating system
  process.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Not programming with shared memory, but instead using message passing, is likely to be the most successful way of
  implementing systems that harness the parallelism that is now endemic in computer hardware.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.53. Missing Opportunities for Polymorphism

- In the context of programming, polymorphism refers to many forms of a particular class of objects or method. But
  polymorphism isn't simply about alternate implementations. Used carefully, polymorphism creates tiny localised
  execution contexts that let us work without the need for verbose if-then-else blocks. Being in a context allows us to
  do the right thing directly, whereas being outside of that context forces us to reconstruct it so that we can then do
  the right thing.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- With careful use of alternate implementations, we can capture context that can help us produce less code that is more
  readable.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - This is best demonstrated with some code, such as the following (unrealistically) simple shopping cart:
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    ```java
    public class ShoppingCart {
      private ArrayList<Item> cart = new ArrayList<Item>();

      public void add(Item item) {
        cart.add(item);
      }

      public Item takeNext() {
        return cart.remove(0);
      }

      public boolean isEmpty() {
        return cart.isEmpty();
      }
    }
    ```

  - Let's say our webshop offers items that can be downloaded and items that need to be shipped. Let's build another
    object that supports these operations:
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    ```java
    public class Shipping {
      public boolean ship(Item item, SurfaceAddress address) {
        ...
      }

      public boolean ship(Item item, EMailAddress address {
        ...
      }
    }
    ```

  - When a client has completed checkout, we need to ship the goods:
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    ```java
    while (!cart.isEmpty()) {
      shipping.ship(cart.takeNext(), ???);
    }
    ```

  - The `???` parameter is asking where to email or snail-mail the item. The context needed to answer this question no
    longer exists. We have could captured the method of shipment in a `boolean` or `enum` and then used an
    `if-then-else` to fill in the missing parameter. Another solution would be to create two classes that both extend
    `Item`. Let's call these `DownloadableItem` and `SurfaceItem`, both implementing a `ship` method:
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    ```java
    public class DownloadableItem implements Item {
      public boolean ship(Shipping shipper, Customer customer) {
        shipper.ship(this, customer.getEmailAddress());
      }
    }

    public class SurfaceItem implements Item {
      public boolean ship(Shipping shipper, Customer customer) {
        shipper.ship(this, customer.getSurfaceAddress());
      }
    }
    ```

- While there are cases where it's much more practical to use `if-then-else` instead of polymorphism, it is more often
  the case that a more polymorphic coding style will yield a smaller, more readable and less fragile codebase. The
  number of missed opportunities is a simple count of the `if-then-else` statements in our code.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.54. News of the Weird: Testers Are Your Friends

- Programmers often have an adversarial relationship with the people who test their software.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- You may think the testers make you look bad by reporting trivial issues. But when customers are thrilled because they
  weren't bothered by all those "little things" that QC made you fix, then you look great.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.55. One Binary

- Build a single binary that you can identify and promote through all the stages in the release pipeline. Hold
  environment-specific details in the environment.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Keep the environment information versioned, too. There's nothing worse than breaking an environment configuration and
  not being able to figure out what changed. The environmental information should be versioned separately from the
  code, since they'll change at different rates and for different reasons.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.56. Only the Code Tells the Truth

- When you look at the source code, the meaning of the program should be apparent. To know what a program does, the
  source is ultimately all you can be sure of looking at. Even the most accurate requirements document does not tell
  the whole truth: it does not contain the detailed story of what the program is actually doing, only the high-level
  intentions of the requirements analyst.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- A design document may capture a planned design, but it will lack the necessary detail of the implementation. These
  documents are likely to have lost sync with the current implementation.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- What can you do to actually make your code tell the truth as clearly as possible?
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Strive for good names.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Structure your code with respect to cohesive functionality, which also eases naming.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Decouple your code to achieve orthogonality.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Write automated tests explaining the intended behaviour and check the interfaces.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Refactor mercilessly when you learn how to code a simpler, better solution.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Make your code as simple as possible to read and understand.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Treat your code like any other composition, such as a poem, an essay, a public blog, or an important email. Craft
  what you express carefully, so that it does what it should and communicates as directly as possible what it is doing;
  so that it still communicates your intention when you are no longer around. Remember that useful code is used much
  longer than ever intended.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.57. Own (and Refactor) the Build

- It is not uncommon for teams that are otherwise highly disciplined about coding practices to neglect build scripts,
  either out of a belief that they are merely an unimportant detail or from a fear that they are complex and need to be
  tended to by release engineers. Unmaintainable build scripts with duplication and errors cause problems of the same
  magnitude as those in poorly factored code.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- The code is useless without being built, and the build is what defines the component architecture of the application.
  The build is an essential part of the development process, and decisions about the build process can make the code
  and the coding simpler.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Understanding the build can simplify the entire development lifecycle and reduce costs. Automating configuration in
  the build can enable you to get consistent results when multiple people are working on a project, avoiding an "it
  works for me" conversation. Many build tools allow you to run reports on code quality, allowing you to sense
  potential problems early.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.58. Pair Program and Feel the Flow

- To succeed with pair programming, both individual team members and the team as a whole have to put forth some effort.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- As a team member, be patient with developers less experienced than you. Confront your fears about being intimidated
  by more skilled developers. Realise that people are different, and value it. Be aware of your own strengths and
  weaknesses, as well as those of other team members. You may be surprised by how much you can learn from your
  colleagues.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- There are numerous situations where flow can be broken, but where pair programming helps you keep it:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Reduce the "Truck Factor"**:

    - It's a slightly morbid thought experiment, but how many of your team members would have to be hit by a truck
      before the team became unable to complete the final deliverable? In other words, how dependent is your delivery
      on certain team members?
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - Is knowledge privileged or shared? If you have been rotating tasks among pairs, there is always someone else who
      has the knowledge and can complete the work. Your team's flow is not as affected by the "truck factor."
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Solve Problems Effectively**:

    - If you are pair programming and you run into a challenging problem, you always have someone to discuss it with.
      Such dialogue is more likely to open up possibilities than if you are stuck by yourself.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - As the work rotates, your solution will be revisited and reconsidered by the next pair, so it does not matter if
      you did not choose the optimal solution initially.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Integrate Smoothly**:

    - If your current task involves calling another piece of code, you hope the names of the methods, the docs, and the
      tests are descriptive enough to give you a grasp of what it does. If not, pairing with a developer who was
      involved in writing that code will give you better overview and faster integration into your own code.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - Additionally, you can use the discussion as an opportunity to improve the naming, docs, and testing.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Mitigate Interruptions**:

    - If someone comes over to ask you a question, or your phone rings, or you have to answer an urgent email, or you
      have to attend a meeting, your pair programming partner can keep on coding.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - When you return, your partner is still in the flow and you will quickly catch up and rejoin him.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Bring New Team Members Up to Speed Quickly**:

    - With pair programming, and a suitable rotation of pairs and tasks, newcomers quickly get to know both the code
      and the other team members.

### 1.1.59. Prefer Domain-Specific Types to Primitive Types

- Using classes such as `Velocity_In_Knots` and `Distance_In_Nautical_Miles` adds a lot of value with respect to code
  quality:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - The code becomes more readable, as it expresses concepts of a domain, not just Float or String.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - The code becomes more testable, as the code encapsulates behaviour that is easily testable.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - The code facilitates reuse across applications and systems.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- The approach is equally valid for users of both statically and dynamically typed languages. The only difference is
  that developers using statically typed languages get some help from the compiler, while those embracing dynamically
  typed languages are more likely to rely on their unit tests. The style of checking may be different, but the
  motivation and style of expression is not.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Start exploring domain-specific types for the purpose of developing quality software.

### 1.1.60. Prevent Errors

- Error messages are the most critical interactions between the user and the rest of the system. They happen when
  communication between the user and the system is near the breaking point.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- It is easy to think of an error as being caused by a wrong input from the user. However, people make mistakes in
  predictable, systematic ways. So it is possible to "debug" the communication between the user and the rest of the
  system just as you would between other system components.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Cues are different from instructions: cues tend to be hints; instructions are verbose. Cues occur at the point of
  interaction; instructions appear before the point of interaction. Cues provide context; instructions dictate use.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Another way of avoiding errors is to offer defaults.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Whatever the cause, systems should be tolerant of errors. You can facilitate this by providing multiple levels of
  undo to all actions - and, in particular, actions that have the potential to destroy or amend users' data.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Most errors are systematic - the result of misunderstandings between the user and the software. Understanding how
  users think, interpret information, make decisions, and input data will help you debug the interactions between your
  software and your users.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.61. Put Everything Under Version Control

- When you set up your project, don't be stingy: place all the project's assets under version control. In addition to
  the source code, include the documentation, tools, build scripts, test cases, artwork, and even libraries. With the
  complete project safely tucked into the (regularly backed up) repository, the potential damage of losing your disk or
  data is minimised. Setting up for development on a new machine involves simply checking out the project from the
  repository. This simplifies distributing, building, and testing the code on different platforms: on each machine, a
  single update command will ensure that the software is the current version.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.62. Put the Mouse Down and Step Away from the Keyboard

- The next time you hit a nasty problem, do yourself a favour. Once you really understand the problem, go do something
  involving the creative side of your brain - sketch out the problem, listen to some music, or just take a walk
  outside. Sometimes the best thing you can do to solve a problem is to put the mouse down and step away from the
  keyboard.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.63. Read Code

- We programmers are weird creatures. We love writing code. But when it comes to reading it, we usually shy away. After
  all, writing code is so much more fun, and reading code is hard - sometimes almost impossible. Reading other people's
  code is particularly hard. Not necessarily because other people's code is bad, but because they probably think and
  solve problems in a different way than you. But did you ever consider that reading someone else's code could improve
  your own?
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- The next time you read some code, stop and think for a moment. Is the code easy or hard to read? If it is hard to
  read, why is that? Is the formatting poor? Is naming inconsistent or illogical? Are several concerns mixed together
  in the same piece of code? Try to learn from other people's mistakes, so that your code won't contain the same ones.
  You may receive a few surprises. For example, dependency-breaking techniques may be good for low coupling, but they
  can sometimes also make code harder to read. And what some people call elegant code, others call unreadable.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- If the code is easy to read, stop to see if there is something useful you can learn from it. Maybe there's a design
  pattern in use that you don't know about, or had previously struggled to implement. Perhaps the methods are shorter
  and their names more expressive than yours.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Reading your own old code, from a project you are not currently working on, can also be an enlightening experience.
  Start with some of your oldest code and work your way forward to the present. You will probably find that it is not
  at all as easy to read as when you wrote it. Look at how you have developed your skills over the years - it can be
  truly motivating. Observe what areas of the code are hard to read, and consider whether you are still writing code in
  the same way today.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.64. Read the Humanities

- In all but the smallest development project, people work with people. In all but the most abstracted field of
  research, people write software for people to support them in some goal of theirs. People write software with people
  for people. It's a people business.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Unfortunately, what is taught to programmers too often equips them very poorly to deal with people they work for and
  with.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Any language we use to speak to one another is not - cannot be - a serialisation format for getting a thought or idea
  or picture out of one person's head and into another's.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Our ability to understand one another at all does not arise from shared definitions, it arises from a shared
  experience, from a form of life. This may be one reason why programmers who are steeped in their problem domain tend
  to do better than those who stand apart from it.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Programmers build and use tools, we think about and create and modify and recreate tools. Tools are objects of
  interest to us. A tool becomes an invisible thing understood only in use. For users, tools only become objects of
  interest when they don't work. This difference in emphasis is worth bearing in mind whenever usability is under
  discussion.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- When programmers ask users about their desires for a system, we tend to ask for definitions built out of predicates.
  This is very convenient for us. The terms in the predicates can very easily become attributes on a class or columns
  in a table. These sorts of categories are crisp, disjoint, and tidy. Unfortunately, that just isn't how people in
  general understand the world. They understand it in ways that are based on examples. Some examples, so-called
  prototypes, are better than others and so the resulting categories are fuzzy, they overlap, they can have rich
  internal structure.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.65. Reinvent the Wheel Often

- Reinventing the wheel and getting it wrong is more valuable than nailing it first time. There are lessons learned
  from trial and error that have an emotional component to them that reading a technical book alone just cannot
  deliver.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Learned facts and book smarts are crucial, but becoming a great programmer is as much about acquiring experience as
  it is about collecting facts. Reinventing the wheel is as important to a developer's education and skill as
  weightlifting is to a body builder.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.66. Resist the Temptation of the Singleton Pattern

- Experience shows that most singletons really do more harm than good. They hinder testability and harm
  maintainability. Unfortunately, this additional wisdom is not as widespread as it should be, and singletons continue
  to be irresistible to many programmers.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- They are worth resisting:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **The Single-Instance Requirement is Often Imagined**:

    - In many cases, it's pure speculation that no additional instances will be needed in the future. Broadcasting such
      speculative properties across an application's design is bound to cause pain at some point.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - Requirements will change. Good design embraces this. Singletons don't.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Singletons Cause Implicit Dependencies Between Conceptually Independent Units of Code**:

    - This is problematic both because they are hidden and because they introduce unnecessary coupling between units.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - This code smell becomes pungent when you try to write unit tests, which depend on loose coupling and the ability
      to selectively substitute a mock implementation for a real one. Singletons prevent such straightforward mocking.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Singletons Also Carry Implicit Persistent State, Which Again Hinders Unit Testing**:

    - Unit testing depends on tests being independent of one another, so the tests can be run in any order and the
      program can be set to a known state before the execution of every unit test.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - Once you have introduced singletons with mutable state, this may be hard to achieve. In addition, such globally
      accessible persistent state makes it harder to reason about the code, especially in a multithreaded environment.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Multithreading Introduces Further Pitfalls to the Singleton Pattern**:

    - As straight-forward locking on access is not very efficient, the so-called Double-Checked Locking Pattern (DCLP)
      has gained in popularity. Unfortunately, this may be a further form of fatal attraction. It turns out that in
      many languages, DCLP is not thread-safe and, even where it is, there are still opportunities to get it subtly
      wrong.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- The clean-up of singletons may present a final challenge:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **There is No Support for Explicitly Killing Singletons**:

    - This can be a serious issue in some contexts - for example, in a plug-in architecture where a plug-in can only be
      safely unloaded after all its objects have been cleaned up.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **There is No Order to the Implicit Clean-Up of Singletons at Program Exit**:

    - This can be troublesome for applications that contain singletons with interdependencies. When shutting down such
      applications, one singleton may access another that has already been destroyed.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Some of these shortcomings can be overcome by introducing additional mechanisms. However, this comes at the cost of
  additional complexity in code that could have been avoided by choosing an alternative design.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Restrict your use of the Singleton pattern to the classes that truly must never be instantiated more than once.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.67. Simplicity Comes from Reduction

- It's natural, particularly when you're in a rush, to just want to make the most minimal changes to an existing block
  of code, even if it is awful. Most programmers will preserve bad code, fearing that starting anew will require
  significantly more effort than just going back to the beginning. That can be true for code that is close to working,
  but there is just some code that is beyond all help.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- The best approach to fixing bad code is to flip into a mode where the code is mercilessly refactored, shifted around,
  or deleted.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.68. Start from Yes

- Sometimes the other person will simply have an idea that you find incompatible with your view of the product. You
  will likely find it's usually helpful to turn that "Why?" on yourself. Sometimes the act of voicing the reason will
  make it clear that your first reaction doesn't make sense. If not, you might need to kick it up a notch and bring in
  other key decision makers. Remember, the goal of all of this is to say yes to the other person and try to make it
  work, not just for him but for you and your team as well.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- If you can voice a compelling explanation as to why the feature request is incompatible with the existing product,
  then you are likely to have a productive conversation about whether you are building the right product. Regardless of
  how that conversation concludes, everyone will focus more sharply on what the product is, and what it is not.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Starting from yes means working with your colleagues, not against them.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.69. Step Back and Automate, Automate, Automate

- Why do people do the same task over and over instead of stepping back and taking the time to automate it? Here are a
  few common misconceptions:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Automation is Only For Testing**:

    - Repetitive tasks abound in any project: version control, compiling, building JAR files, documentation generation,
      deployment, and reporting. For many of these tasks, the script is mightier than the mouse. Executing tedious
      tasks becomes faster and more reliable.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **I Have an IDE, So I Don't Have to Automate**:

    - Modern IDEs have thousands of potential settings, and it is essentially impossible to ensure that all team
      members have identical configurations. Build automation systems such as Ant or Autotools give you control and
      repeatability.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **I Need to Learn Exotic Tools in Order to Automate**:

    - You can go a long way with a decent shell language (such as `bash` or PowerShell) and a build automation system.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - If you need to interact with websites, use a tool such as iMacros or Selenium.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **I Can't Automate This Task Because I Can't Deal With These File Formats**:

    - If a part of your process requires Word documents, spreadsheets, or images, it may be challenging to automate it.
      Often, a slight tweak in the process can yield good results with a dramatic reduction in tediousness, plain text,
      comma-separated values, XML files might be better alternatives to the files you may be using that would be
      difficult to automate.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **I Don't Have Time to Figure it Out**:

    - You don't have to learn all of `bash` or Ant to get started. Learn as you go. When you have a task that you think
      can and should be automated, learn just enough about your tools to do it.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.70. Take Advantage of Code Analysis Tools

- Don't let testing be the end of your quality assurance - take advantage of analysis tools, and don't be afraid to roll
  your own.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.71. Test for Required Behaviour, Not Incidental Behaviour

- When tests are hardwired to implementation incidentals, changes to the implementation that are actually compatible
  with the required behaviour may cause tests to fail, likely making them very brittle.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Overspecified tests are often a problem with whitebox approaches to unit testing. Whitebox tests use the structure of
  the code to determine the test cases needed. The typical failure mode of whitebox testing is that the tests end up
  asserting that the code does what the code does. Simply restating what is already obvious from the code adds no value
  and leads to a false sense of progress and security.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- To be effective, tests need to state contractual obligations rather than parrot implementations. They need to take a
  blackbox view of the units under test, sketching out the interface contracts in executable form. Therefore, align
  tested behaviour with required behaviour.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.72. Test Precisely and Concretely

- In specifying behaviour, tests should not simply be accurate: they must also be precise.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.73. Test While You Sleep (And Over Weekends)

- Are you constantly finding it difficult to get enough computing power during the work day? If so, what are your test
  servers doing outside of normal work hours? More often than not, the test servers are idling overnight and over the
  week end. You can use this to your advantage:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Have You Been Guilty of Committing a Change Without Running All the Tests?**:

    - One of the main reasons programmers don't run test suites before committing code is because of the length of time
      they may take. When deadlines are looming and push comes to shove, humans naturally start cutting corners.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - One way to address this is to break down your large test suite into two or more profiles. A smaller, mandatory
      test profile that is quick to run will help to ensure that tests are run before each commit. All of the test
      profiles (including the mandatory profile - just to be sure) can be automated to run overnight, ready to report
      their results in the morning.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Have You Had Enough Opportunity to Test the Stability of Your Product?**:

    - Longer-running tests are vital for identifying memory leaks and other stability issues. They are seldom run
      during the day, as it will tie up time and resources. You could automate a soak test to be run during the night,
      and a bit longer over the weekend.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Are You Getting Quality Time on Your Performance Testing Environment?**:

    - It's a common occurrence for teams/colleagues to need their environments during the day. The servers and the
      network are not as busy during the night or over the weekend. It's an ideal time to run some quality performance
      tests.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Are There Too Many Permutations to Test Manually?**:

    - Manually testing all of of an application's possible permutations is very time consuming and most likely done
      close to a release due to resource pressure. Alas, it may be too late in the cycle to catch certain nasty bugs.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - Automated tests run during the night or over weekends will ensure that all the application's possible
      permutations are tested more often.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.74. Testing is the Engineering Rigour of Software Development

- Testing takes time, just like structural analysis takes time in "hard" engineering. Both activities ensure the
  quality of the end product. It's time for software developers to take up the mantle of responsibility for what they
  produce. Testing alone isn't sufficient, but it is necessary. Testing is the engineering rigour of software
  development.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.75. The Boy Scout Rule

- Always check a module in cleaner than when you checked it out. Regardless of who the original author was, always make
  some effort, no matter how small, to improve the module.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.76. The Golden Rule of API Design

- It's not enough to write tests for an API you develop; you have to write unit tests for code that uses your API. When
  you follow this rule, you learn first-hand the hurdles that your users will have to overcome when they try to test
  their code independently.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.77. The Guru Myth

- Consider the best programmer you've ever met: at one point, that person knew less about software than you do now. If
  someone seems like a guru, it's because of years dedicated to learning and refining thought processes. A "guru" is
  simply a smart person with relentless curiosity.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Removing the guru myth also means removing a perceived barrier to improvement. Instead of a magical barrier, you can
  see a continuum along which you can advance.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- One of software's biggest obstacles is smart people who purposefully propagate the guru myth. This might be done out
  of ego, or as a strategy to increase one's value as perceived by a client or employer. Ironically, this attitude can
  make smart people less valuable, since they don't contribute to the growth of their peers. We don't need gurus. We
  need experts willing to develop other experts in their field. There is room for all of us.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.78. The Linker Is Not a Magical Program

- Although it is not always immediately obvious why you get a particular linker message, there is nothing magical about
  linkers. The mechanics are straightforward; it's the details you have to figure out in each case.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.79. The Longevity of Interim Solutions

- In most systems and teams, you will find some software that is somewhat segregated from the system, that is
  considered a draft to be changed sometime, that does not follow the standards and guidelines that shaped the rest of
  the code. Inevitably, you will hear developers complaining about these. The reasons for their creation are many and
  varied, but the key to an interim solution's success is simple: it is useful.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Interim solutions, however, acquire inertia (or momentum, depending on your point of view). Because they are there,
  ultimately useful and widely accepted, there is no immediate need to do anything else.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- You will create many solutions; some of them will be interim, most of them will be useful. The best way to overcome
  interim solutions is to make them superfluous, to provide a more elegant and useful solution. May you be granted the
  serenity to accept the things you cannot change, the courage to change the things you can, and the wisdom to know the
  difference.

### 1.1.80. The Professional Programmer

- The single most important trait of a professional programmer is personal responsibility. Professional programmers
  take responsibility for their career, their estimates, their schedule commitments, their mistakes, and their
  workmanship.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- A professional programmer does not pass that responsibility off on others:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **If You are a Professional, Then You Are Responsible For Your Own Career**:

    - You are responsible for reading and learning. You are responsible for staying up to date with the industry and
      the technology.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Professionals Take Responsible for the Code They Write**:

    - They do not release code unless they know it works. How can you possibly consider yourself a professional if you
      are willing to release code that you are not sure of?
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - Professional programmers expect QA to find nothing because they don't release their code until they've thoroughly
      tested it. Of course, QA will find some problems, because no one is perfect. But as professionals, our attitude
      must be that we will leave nothing for QA to find.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Professionals are Team Players**:

    - They take responsibility for the output of the whole team, not just their own work. They help one another, teach
      one another, learn from one another, and even cover for one another when necessary.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - When one teammate falls down, the others step in, knowing that one day they'll be the ones to need cover.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Professionals Do Not Tolerate Big Bug Lists**:

    - A huge bug list is sloppy. Systems with thousands of issues in the issue-tracking database are tragedies of
      carelessness.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - **Professionals Do Not Make a Mess**:

    - They take pride in their workmanship. They keep their code clean, well structured, and easy to read. They follow
      agreed-upon standards and best practices.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

    - They do not abandon their principles when deadlines loom.
      [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.81. The Road to Performance is Littered with Dirty Code Bombs

- More often than not, performance tuning a system requires you to alter code. When we need to alter code, every chunk
  that is overly complex or highly coupled is a dirty code bomb lying in wait to derail the effort. The first casualty
  of dirty code will be your schedule. If the way forward is smooth, it will be easy to predict when you'll finish.
  Unexpected encounters with dirty code will make it very difficult to make a sane prediction.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- In fact, we have many ways of measuring and controlling the degree and depth of coupling and complexity of our code.
  Software metrics can be used to count the occurrences of specific features in our code. The values of these counts do
  correlate with code quality. Two of a number of metrics that measure coupling are fan-in and fan-out:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Consider fan-out for classes: it is defined as the number of classes referenced either directly or indirectly from
    a class of interest. You can think of this as a count of all the classes that must be compiled before your class
    can be compiled.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Fan-in, on the other hand, is a count of all classes that depend upon the class of interest. Knowing fan-out and
    fan-in, we can calculate an instability factor using `I = fanOut / (fanIn + fanOut)`.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - As I approaches 0, the package becomes more stable. As `I` approaches 1, the package becomes unstable. Packages
    that are stable are low-risk targets for recoding, whereas unstable packages are more likely to be filled with
    dirty code bombs.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- When using metrics, one must remember that they are only rules of thumb. Based purely on math, we can see that
  increasing `fanIn` without changing `fanOut` will move `I` closer to 0. There is, however, a downside to a very large
  fan-in value: these classes will be more difficult to alter without breaking dependents. Also, without addressing
  fan-out, you're not really reducing your risks, so some balance must be applied.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.82. The Single Responsibility Principle

- A subsystem, module, class, or even a function, should not have more than one reason to change.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Good system design means that we separate the system into components that can be independently deployed. Independent
  deployment means that if we change one component, we do not have to redeploy any of the others.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Each class can be placed in a component of its own. Or rather, all the reporting classes can go into the reporting
  component. All the database-related classes can go into the repository component. And all the business rules can go
  into the business rule component.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.83. The Unix Tools Are Your Friends

- The small-is-beautiful provenance and open source implementations of the Unix tools make them ubiquitously available,
  even on resource-constrained platforms.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- If none of the available tools matches your needs, it's very easy to extend the world of the Unix tools. Just write a
  program (in any language you fancy) that plays by a few simple rules: your program should perform just a single task;
  it should read data as text lines from its standard input; and it should display its results unadorned by headers and
  other noise on its standard output. Parameters affecting the tool's operation are given in the command line.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.84. Thinking in States

- In most real-world situations, people's relaxed attitude toward state is not an issue. Unfortunately, however, many
  programmers are quite vague about state, too - and that is a problem.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- But how do you begin thinking in states? Extracting expressions to meaningful methods is a very good start, but it is
  just a start. The foundation is to understand state machines.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- State machines are not particularly hard. Visualise them to make them simple to understand and easy to talk about.
  Test-drive your code to unravel valid and invalid states and transitions and to keep them correct. Study the State
  pattern. When you feel comfortable, read up on Design by Contract. It helps you ensure a valid state by validating
  incoming data and the object itself on entry and exit of each public method.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.85. Two Heads Are Often Better Than One

- This "lone wolf" approach to programming has been giving way to a more collaborative approach. This approach has
  developers working more closely with one another and also with non-developers - business and systems analysts,
  quality assurance professionals, and users.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Collaboration is not about asking and answering questions or sitting in meetings. It's about rolling up your sleeves
  with someone else to jointly attack work.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- When pairing, we each bring our collective programming experiences domain as well as technical - to the problem at
  hand and can bring unique insight and experience into writing software effectively and efficiently. Even in cases of
  extreme imbalance in domain or technical knowledge, the more experienced participant invariably learns something from
  the other - perhaps a new keyboard shortcut, or exposure to a new tool or library. For the less-experienced member of
  the pair, this is a great way to get up to speed.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.86. Two Wrongs Can Make a Right (And Are Difficult to Fix)

- Single wrongs can be easy to spot and easy to fix. It is the problems with multiple causes, needing multiple changes,
  that are harder to resolve. In part, this is because easy problems are so easily fixed that people tend to fix them
  relatively quickly and store up the more difficult problems for a later date.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.87. Ubuntu Coding for Your Friends

- Creating software is a technical exercise mixed into a social exercise. We just need to lift our heads more often to
  realise that we are not working in isolation, and we have shared responsibility for increasing the probability of
  success for everyone, not just the development team.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- You can write good-quality code in isolation, all the while lost in self. From one perspective, that is an egocentric
  approach (not ego as in arrogant, but ego as in personal).
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- The quality of the code I write affects the quality of the code you write. What if my code is of poor quality? Even
  if you write very clean code, it is at the points where you use my code that your code quality will degrade to close
  to the quality of my code. You can apply many patterns and techniques to limit the damage, but the damage has already
  been done. I have caused you to do more than what you needed to do, simply because I did not think about you when I
  was living in my moment.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.88. Use the Right Algorithm and Data Structure

- Programmers should not reinvent the wheel, and should use existing libraries where possible. Above all, however,
  programmers should know when, what, and how to reuse. To do that, they should have knowledge of the problem domain
  and of algorithms and data structures.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.89. Verbose Logging Will Disturb Your Sleep

- Too much logging can be as useless as none at all.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- For many systems, the first indication that something is wrong is a log message being written to some log. Mostly,
  this will be the error log. So do yourself a favour: make sure from day one that if something is logged in the error
  log, you're willing to have someone call and wake you in the middle of the night about it. If you can simulate load
  on your system during system testing, looking at a noise-free error log is also a good first indication that your
  system is reasonably robust - or an early warning if it's not.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- A cluttered log is an indication that the system will be hard to control once it reaches production. If you don't
  expect anything to show up in the error log, it will be much easier to know what to do when something does show up.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.90. WET Dilutes Performance Bottlenecks

- The antithesis of DRY is WET (Write Every Time). Your code is WET when knowledge is codified in several different
  implementations. The performance implications of DRY versus WET become very clear when you consider their numerous
  effects on a performance profile. Following DRY helps find and repair a performance bottleneck that would have been
  more difficult to find had the code been WET.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.91. When Programmers and Testers Collaborate

- When testers and programmers start to collaborate, there is less time spent sending bugs back and forth through the
  defect tracking system. Less time is wasted trying to figure out whether something is really a bug or a new feature,
  and more time is spent developing good software to meet customer expectations. There are many opportunities for
  starting collaboration before coding even begins.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- When testers stop thinking that their only job is to break the software and find bugs in the programmers' code,
  programmers stop thinking that testers are "out to get them," and are more open to collaboration. When programmers
  start realising that they are responsible for building quality into their code, testability of the code is a natural
  by-product, and the team can automate more of the regression tests together. The magic of successful teamwork begins.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.92. Write Code As If You Had to Support It for the Rest of Your Life

- There is a simple way to adjust your attitude and always be driven to deliver the best quality products: "write code
  as if you had to support if for the rest of your life."
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- If you accept this notion, many wonderful things will happen. If you were to accept that any of your previous or
  current employers had the right to call you in the middle of the night, asking you to explain the choices you made
  while writing a given method, you would gradually improve toward becoming an expert programmer. You would naturally
  want to come up with better variable and method names. You would stay away from blocks of code comprising hundreds of
  lines. You would seek, learn, and use design patterns. You would write comments, test your code, and refactor
  continually. Supporting all the code you'd ever written for the rest of your life should also be a scalable
  endeavour. You would therefore have no choice but to become better, smarter, and more efficient.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- If you reflect on it, the code you wrote many years ago still influences your career, whether you like it or not. You
  leave a trail of your knowledge, attitude, tenacity, professionalism, level of commitment, and degree of enjoyment
  with every method, class, and module you design and write. People will form opinions about you based on the code that
  they see. If those opinions are constantly negative, you will get less from your career than you hoped. Take care of
  your career, of your clients, and of your users with every line of code - write code as if you had to support it for
  the rest of your life.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.93. Write Small Functions Using Examples

- Using domain-inspired types can often make our functions much smaller, instead of relying on native types. One way to
  find out what those types should be is to find the examples to check in problem domain terms, before writing the
  function.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.94. Write Tests for People

- Good tests act as documentation for the code they are testing. They describe how the code works. For each usage
  scenario, the test(s):
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Describe the context, starting point, or preconditions that must be satisfied.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Illustrate how the software is invoked.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Describe the expected results or postconditions to be verified.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Different usage scenarios will have slightly different versions of each of these. The person trying to understand
  your code should be able to look at a few tests, and by comparing these three parts of the tests in question, be able
  to see what causes the software to behave differently. Each test should clearly illustrate the cause-and-effect
  relationship among these three parts.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Between them, the names of the test class and class method should include at least the starting point and how the
  software is being invoked. This allows the test coverage to be verified via a quick scan of the method names. It can
  also be useful to include the expected results in the test method names as long as this doesn't cause the names to be
  too long to see or read.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.95. You Gotta Care About the Code

- Good code doesn't pop out of thin air. It isn't something that happens by luck when the planets align. To get good
  code, you have to work at it. Hard. And you'll only get good code if you actually care about good code.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Good programming is not born from mere technical competence. Highly intellectual programmers who can write terrible
  code. Mediocre programmers can write very simple code, but write elegant and expressive programs.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- The real difference between adequate programmers and great programmers is this: attitude. Good programming lies in
  taking a professional approach, and wanting to write the best software you can, within the real-world constraints and
  pressures of the software factory.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- To be an excellent programmer, you have to rise above good intentions, and actually care about the code - foster
  positive perspectives and develop healthy attitudes. Great code is carefully crafted by master artisans, not
  thoughtlessly hacked out by sloppy programmers or erected mysteriously by self-professed coding gurus.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- You want to write good code. You want to be a good programmer. So, you care about the code:
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - In any coding situation, you refuse to hack something that only seems to work. You strive to craft elegant code
    that is clearly correct (and has good tests to show that it is correct).
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - You write code that is discoverable (that other programmers can easily pick up and understand), that is
    maintainable (that you, or other programmers, will be easily able to modify in the future), and that is correct
    (you take all steps possible to determine that you have solved the problem, not just made it look like the program
    works).
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - You work well alongside other programmers You consider other programmers and construct code that others can read.
    You want the team to write the best software possible, rather than to make yourself look clever.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - Any time you touch a piece of code, you strive to leave it better than you found it.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

  - You care about code and about programming, so you are constantly learning new languages, idioms, and techniques.
    You apply them only when appropriate.
    [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

### 1.1.96. Your Customers Do Not Mean What They Say

- Customers are always more than happy to say what they want - usually in great detail. The problem is that customers
  don't always tell you the whole truth. They generally don't lie, but they speak in customer speak, not developer
  speak. They use their terms and their contexts. They leave out significant details. They make assumptions that you've
  been at their company for 20 years, just like they have. This is compounded by the fact that many customers don't
  actually know what they want in the first place.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Challenge your customers early, and challenge them often. Don't simply restate what they told you they wanted in
  their words.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Discuss topics numerous times with your customers before you decide that you understand what they need. Try restating
  the problem two or three times with them. Talk to them about the things that happen just before or just after the
  topic you're talking about to get better context. If at all possible, have multiple people tell you about the same
  topic in separate conversations. They will almost always tell you different stories, which will uncover separate yet
  related facts.
  [5.9.1. O'Reilly: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](#591-oreilly-97-things-every-programmer-should-know)

- Use visual aids in your conversations. This could be as simple as using a whiteboard in a meeting, as easy as
  creating a visual mock-up early in the design phase, or as complex as crafting a functional prototype.

## 1.2. `bash` Cookbook

<details open>

<summary>Click to expand/minimise the full contents of this book.</summary>

### 1.2.1. Preface

- Every modern operating system has at least one shell, and some have many. Some shells are command line–oriented, such
  as the shell discussed in this book. Others are graphical, like Windows Explorer or the Macintosh Finder.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- A shell script can save you time and effort, or facilitate consistency and repeatability for some important task.
  Even using an alias to change or shorten the name of a command you use often can have a significant effect.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- There is also sometimes a choice between a clever way to write some code, and a readable way. The readable way is the
  only smart choice.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.1.1. Who Should Read This Book

- This book is for anyone who uses a Unix or Linux system, as well as system administrators who may use several systems
  on any given day. With it, you will be able to create scripts that allow you to accomplish more, in less time, more
  easily, consistently, and repeatable than ever before.

    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- This book assumes you have access to a Unix or Linux system and are familiar with logging in, typing basic commands,
  and using a text editor. You do not have to be root to use the vast majority of the recipes, though there are a few,
  particularly dealing with installing bash, where root access will be needed.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.1.2. About This Book

- This book covers `bash`, the GNU Bourne Again Shell, which is a member of the family of shells that includes the
  original Bourne shell, `sh`, the Korn shell, ksh, and the public domain Korn shell, pdksh. While these and other
  shells such as `dash` and `zsh` are not specifically covered, odds are that most of the scripts will work pretty well
  with them.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- A great part of the Unix philosophy is to build simple tools that do one thing well, then combine them as needed.
  This combination of tools is often accomplished via a shell script because these commands, called pipelines, can be
  long or difficult to remember and type. Where appropriate, the book will cover the use of many of these tools in the
  context of the shell script as the glue that holds the pieces together to achieve the goal.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

##### 1.2.1.2.1. GNU Software

- `bash` and many of the other tools discussed in this book are part of the GNU Project. GNU is a recursive acronym for
  "GNU's Not Unix," and the project dates back to 1984. Its goal is to develop a free (as in freedom) Unix-like
  operating system.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

##### 1.2.1.2.2. A Note About Code Examples

- Examples with a dollar symbol at the start of a line indicates it is a `bash` shell prompt. Each line is a user
  input. The prompt is printed by the shell; you type the remainder of the line. Similarly, the last line in such an
  example is often a prompt (the $ again), to show that the command has ended execution and control has returned to
  the shell.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The hash sign is used as a comment as well as indicating being logged in as root.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

##### 1.2.1.2.3. Useless Use of `cat`

- The following is a useless use of `cat`:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  cat "<file>" | grep "<foo>"
  ```

- The following is a more efficient use of searching for text in a file, as `cat` incurs system overhead, since it runs
  in a subprocess.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  grep "<foo>" "<file>"
  ```

- Sometimes unnecessarily using `cat` actually does serve a purpose. It might be a placeholder to demonstrate a fragment
  of a pipeline, with other commands later replacing it. Or it might be that placing the file near the left side of the
  code draws the eye to it more clearly than if it were obscured after any additional code.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- As a result of the fact processors aren't getting any slower, then use `cat` if you would like to use it, as long as
  it doesn't add any additional code bloat or complexity to scripts.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

##### 1.2.1.2.4. A Note About Perl

- Perl is seldom used in the book, although there a few cases where it makes sense for code examples.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Perl solutions are generally much larger, with significantly more overhead than bash.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Shell scripting is basically glue for combining Unix programs, whereas Perl incorporates much of the functionality of
  the external Unix programs into the language itself. This makes it more efficient and in some ways more portable, at
  the expense of being different and making it harder to efficiently run any external programs you still need.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The choice of which tool to use often has more to do with familiarity than any other reason. The bottom line is
  always get the work done; the choice of tools is secondary.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

### 1.2.2. Beginning `bash`

- The Unix operating system popularised the notion of separating the shell (the part of the system that lets you type
  commands) from everything else: the input/output system, the scheduler, memory management, and all of the other
  things the operating system takes care of for you (and that most users don't want to care about). The shell was just
  one more program; it was a program whose job was executing other programs on behalf of users.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Modern shells are very convenient. For example, they remember commands that you've typed, and let you reuse those
  commands. Modern shells also let you edit those commands, so they don't have to be the same each time. And modern
  shells let you define your own command abbreviations, shortcuts, and other features. For an experienced user, typing
  commands (e.g., with shorthand, shortcuts, and command completion) is a lot more efficient and effective than
  dragging things around in a fancy windowed interface.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Beyond simple convenience, shells are programmable. There are many sequences of commands that you type again and
  again. A shell is also a programming language that's specially designed to work with your computer system's commands.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Whenever you find yourself doing a task repeatedly, you should try to automate it by writing a shell script. There
  are more powerful scripting languages, like Perl, Python, and Ruby, but the Unix shell (whatever flavour of shell
  you're using) is a great place to start.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.2.1. Why `bash`?

- `bash` is everywhere. It may not be the newest, and it's arguably not the fanciest or the most powerful (though if
  not, it comes close), nor is it the only shell that's distributed as open source software - but it is ubiquitous.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `bash` is commonly the default user shell on every Linux distribution. In the rare cases where `bash` doesn't ship
  with the operating system, it's easy to install. It's even available for Windows, via Cygwin and also the new Linux
  Subsystem (Ubuntu). `bash` is both a powerful programming language and a good user interface, and you won't find
  yourself sacrificing keyboard shortcuts to get elaborate programming features.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You can't possibly go wrong by learning `bash`. The most common default shells are the old Bourne shell and `bash`,
  which is mostly Bourne shell–compatible. One of these shells is certainly present on any modern, major Unix or
  Unix-like operating system.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- There are many good alternatives, and you may find one you like better - though it probably won't be as ubiquitous as
  `bash`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.2.2. The `bash` Shell

- `bash` is a shell: a command interpreter. The main purpose of `bash` (or of any shell) is to allow you to interact
  with the computer's operating system so that you can accomplish whatever you need to do.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.2.3. Showing Where You Are

- `pwd` stands for print working directory and takes two options. `--logical` displays your logical path and is the
  default. `--physical` displays your physical location, which may differ from your logical path if you have followed a
  symbolic link. Similarly, the `cd` command also provides `--physical` and `--logical` switches:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  bash-4.3$ pwd
  /tmp/dir2

  bash-4.3$ pwd --logical
  /tmp/dir2

  bash-4.3$ pwd --physical
  /tmp/dir1
  ```

#### 1.2.2.4. Finding & Running Commands

- Try the `type`, `which`, `apropos`, `locate`, `slocate`, `find`, and `ls` commands when you need to find and run a
  particular command under `bash`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- **Finding Commands**:

  - `bash` keeps a list of directories in which it should look for commands in an environment variable called `PATH`.
    The `bash` builtin `type` command searches your environment (including aliases, keywords, functions, builtins,
    directories in `$PATH`, and the command hash table) for executable commands matching its arguments and displays the
    type and location of any matches.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The `which` command is similar to `type` but only searches your $PATH (and `csh` aliases). It may vary from system
    to system (it's usually a csh shell script on BSD, but a binary on Linux). Use these commands when you know the
    name of a command and need to know exactly where it's located, or to see if it's on this computer.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- **Assistance with Executing Commands**:

  - Almost all commands come with some form of help on how to use them. Usually there is online documentation called
    manpages, where `man` is short for manual. These are accessed using the man command. Many programs also have a
    builtin help facility, accessed by providing a "help me" argument such as `-h` or `--help`. Some programs,
    especially on other operating systems, will give you help if you don't give them arguments. Some Unix commands will
    also do that, but a great many of them will not. This is due to the way that Unix commands fit together into
    something called pipelines.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - If you don't know or can't remember the name of the command you need? `apropos` searches manpage names and
    descriptions for regular expressions supplied as arguments. This is incredibly useful when you don't remember the
    name of the command you need.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- **Finding Files**:

  - `locate` and `slocate` consult database files about the system (usually compiled and updated by a job run from the
    scheduler system `cron`) to find files or commands almost instantly. The location of the actual database files,
    what is indexed therein, and how often it is checked may vary from system to system.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `slocate` (secure locate) stores permission information (in addition to filenames and paths) so that it will not
    list programs to which the user does not have access.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - On most Linux systems, `locate` is a symbolic link to `slocate`; other systems may have separate programs, or may
    not have slocate at all.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Try using `ls`. If the command you wish to run is in your current directory, you must prefix it with a `./` since the
  current working directory is usually not in your $PATH for security reasons.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.2.5. Getting Information About Files

- Use the `ls`, `stat`, `file`, or `find` commands to get more information about a file, such as what it is, who owns
  it, if it's executable, how many hard links it has, or when it was last accessed or changed.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.2.6. Using Shell Quoting

- Enclose a string in single quotes unless it contains elements that you want the shell to interpolate. Unquoted text
  and even text enclosed in double quotes is subject to shell expansion and substitution.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You can't embed a single quote inside single quotes, even if using a backslash, since nothing (not even the
  backslash) is interpolated inside single quotes. But you can work around that by using double quotes with escapes, or
  by escaping a single quote outside of surrounding single quotes.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.2.7. Determining if You Are Running Interactively

- Use the `case` statement if you have some code you want to run only if you are (or are not) running interactively.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  case "$-" in
  *i*) # Code for interactive shell here
  ;;
  *) # Code for non-interactive shell here
  ;;
  esac
  ```

- `$-` is a string listing of all the current shell option flags. It will contain `i` if the shell is interactive.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You may also see code like the following, but the previous example is preferred.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  if [ -n "$PS1" ]; then
    echo This shell is interactive
  else
    echo This shell is not interactive
  fi
  ```

### 1.2.3. Standard Output

- No software is worth anything if there is no output of some sort, but I/O has long been one of the nastier areas of
  computing.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- One of the most important ideas behind the Unix operating system was that everything looked like a file (an ordered
  sequence of bytes). The operating system was responsible for this magic. It didn't matter whether you were writing to
  a file on the disk, the terminal, a tape drive, a memory stick, or something else; your program only needed to know
  how to write to a file, and the operating system would take it from there. That approach greatly simplified the
  problem.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- When you run a program, you still have to connect it to output files and input files. That task doesn't go away, but
  the shell makes it trivially easy. A command as simple as the example below reads its input from `input_file` and
  sends its output to `output_file`. If you omit the `> output_file`, the output goes to your terminal window. If you
  omit the `< input_file`, the program takes its input from the keyboard. The program literally doesn't know where its
  output is going, or where its input is coming from.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  do_something < input_file > output_file
  ```

#### 1.2.3.1. Writing Output to the Terminal/Window

- The `echo` command parses all the arguments on the `echo` command line. The shell is parsing the arguments on the
  `echo` command line (like it does for every other command line). This means that it does all its substitutions,
  wildcard matching, and other things before handing the arguments off to `echo`. Since they are parsed as arguments,
  the spacing between arguments is ignored.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ echo this   was   very   widely   spaced
  this was very widely spaced
  ```

- Normally the fact that the shell is very forgiving about whitespace between arguments is a helpful feature.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.3.2. Writing Output but Preserving Space

- Enclosing the string in quotes as a parameter for the `echo` command will help preserve spacing.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ echo "this was very widely spaced"
  this was very widely spaced

  $ echo 'this was very widely spaced'
  this was very widely spaced
  ```

- Since the words are enclosed in quotes, they form a single argument to the `echo` command. That argument is a string,
  and the shell doesn't need to interfere with the contents of the string. In fact, by using single quotes (`''`) you
  explicitly tell the shell not to interfere with the string at all. If you use double quotes (`""`), some shell
  substitutions do take place (variable, arithmetic, and tilde expansions and command substitutions), but since we have
  none in the example, the shell has nothing to change. When in doubt, use the single quotes.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.3.3. Writing Output with More Formatting Control

- Use the `printf` builtin command when you want more control over the formatting and placement of output.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ printf '%s = %d\n' Lines $LINES
  Lines = 24

  $ printf '%-10.10s = %4.2f\n' 'Gigahertz' 1.92735
  Gigahertz = 1.93
  ```

- The `printf` builtin command behaves like the C language library call, where the first argument is the format control
  string and the successive arguments are formatted according to the format specifications (`%`).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The numbers between the `%` and the format type (`s` or `f` in our example) provide additional formatting details.
  For the floating-point type (`f`), the first number (`4` in the `4.2` specifier) is the width of the entire field.
  The second number (`2`) is how many digits should be printed to the right of the decimal point. Note that it rounds
  the answer.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- For a string, the first number is the maximum field width, and the second is the number of bytes to be printed. The
  string will be truncated (if longer than `max`) or blank padded (if less than min) as needed. When the `max` and`min`
  specifiers are the same, then the string is guaranteed to be that length. The negative sign on the specifier means to
  left-align the string (within its field width). Without the minus sign, the string would right-justify, thus:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ printf '%10.10s = %4.2f\n' 'Gigahertz' 1.92735
    Gigahertz = 1.93
  ```

#### 1.2.3.4. Writing Output Without the New Line

- Exclude the `\n` when using `printf` to produce an output without the default new line:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ printf "%s %s" next prompt
  next prompt$
  ```

- With `echo`, use the `-n` option:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ echo -n prompt
  prompt$
  ```

- Because of the powerful and flexible formatting that `printf` provides, and because it is a builtin with very little
  overhead to invoke (unlike in other shells or older versions of `bash`, where `printf` was a standalone executable),
  `printf` will be used for many examples throughout this book.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.3.5. Appending Rather than Clobbering Output

- The double greater-than sign (`>>`) is a `bash` redirector that means append the output:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ ls > /tmp/ls.out

  $ cd ../elsewhere

  $ ls >> /tmp/ls.out

  $ cd ../another/dir

  $ ls >> /tmp/ls.out

  $
  ```

- The first line includes a redirect that truncates the file if it exists and starts with a clean (empty) file, filling
  it with the output from the `ls` command. The second and third invocations of `ls` use the double greater-than sign
  (`>>`) to indicate appending to, rather than replacing the contents of, the output file.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.3.6. Using Just the Beginning of End of a File

- Use the `head` or `tail` command when you need to display just the beginning or end of a file. By default, `head`
  will output the first 10 lines and `tail` will output the last 10 lines of the given file.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.3.7. Throwing Output Away

- Sometimes you don't want to save the output into a file; in fact, sometimes you don't even want to see it at all.
  Unix and Linux systems have a special device that isn't real hardware at all, just a bit bucket where we can dump
  unwanted data. It's called `/dev/null` and is perfect for these situations. Any data written there is simply thrown
  away, so it takes up no disk space. Redirection makes it easy.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  example_command 2> /dev/null

  example_command > /dev/null 2>&1
  ```

#### 1.2.3.8. Saving or Grouping Output from Several Commands

- You want to capture the output with a redirect, but you're typing several commands on one line. The final redirect
  applies only to the last command, the last ls on that line. All the other output appears on the screen (i.e., does
  not get redirected).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  pwd; ls; cd ../elsewhere; pwd; ls > /tmp/all.out
  ```

- Use braces `({ })` to group these commands together; then redirection applies to the output from all commands in the
  group.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  { pwd; ls; cd ../elsewhere; pwd; ls; } > /tmp/all.out

  (pwd; ls; cd ../elsewhere; pwd; ls) > /tmp/all.out
  ```

- The curly braces in the previous example are actually reserved words, so they must be surrounded by whitespace. Also,
  the trailing semicolon is required before the closing brace.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The curly braces are just a way to group several commands together, more like a shorthand for our redirecting, so
  that we don't have to redirect each command separately. Commands enclosed in parentheses, however, run in another
  instance of the shell, a child of the current shell called a subshell.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The subshell is almost identical to the current shell's environment - i.e., variables, including `$PATH`, are all the
  same, but traps are handled differently. Because a subshell is used to execute the cd commands, when the subshell
  exits, your main shell remains where it started. That is, its current directory hasn't moved, and its variables
  haven't changed.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- With the curly braces used for grouping, you end up in the new directory (`../elsewhere` in the example above). Any
  other changes that you make (variable assignments, for example) will be made to your current shell instance. While
  both approaches result in the same output, they leave you in very different places.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.3.9. Connecting Two Programs by Using Output as Input

- Using the pipe symbol means we don't have to invent a temporary filename, remember it, and remember to delete it.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Commands run connected by pipes are run in separate processes. While such a subtlety can often be ignored, there are
  a few times when the implications of this are important.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.3.10. Saving a Copy of Output Even While Using It as Input

- Using the `tee` command to split the output into two identical streams, one that is written to a file and the other
  that is written to standard output.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  find / -name '*.c' -print | tee /tmp/all.my.sources
  ```

- In the previous example we did not redirect standard error at all. This means that any errors, like you might expect
  will be printed to the screen but won't show up in the tee file. This is addressed in the example below. It won't be
  neatly separated, but it will be captured.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  find / -name '*.c' -print 2>&1 | tee /tmp/all.my.sources
  ```

#### 1.2.3.11. Keeping Files Safe from Accidental Overwriting

- The `noclobber` option tells bash not to overwrite any existing files when you redirect output. If the file to which
  you redirect output doesn't (yet) exist, everything works as normal, with bash creating the file as it opens it for
  output. If the file already exists, however, you will get an error message.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Disabling the noclobber option (just in case it has already been set).
  $ set +o noclobber

  # Creating the file.
  $ echo something > my.file

  # Overwriting the file.
  $ echo some more > my.file

  # Enabling the noclobber option.
  $ set -o noclobber

  # Attempting to overwrite the file.
  $ echo something > my.file
  bash: my.file: cannot overwrite existing file

  # Appending the file's contents.
  $ echo some more >> my.file
  ```

- The `noclobber` option only refers to the shell's clobbering of a file when redirecting output. It will not stop
  other file manipulating actions of other programs from clobbering files.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.3.12. Clobbering a File on Purpose

- Use `>|` to redirect your output. Even if noclobber is set, bash ignores its setting and overwrites the file.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Creating the file.
  $ echo something > my.file

  # Enabling the noclobber option.
  $ set -o noclobber

  # Overwriting the file.
  $ echo some more >| my.file

  # Reading the file.
  $ cat my.file
  some more

  # Attempting to overwrite the file.
  $ echo once again > my.file
  bash: my.file: cannot overwrite existing file
  ```

### 1.2.4. Standard Input

- Whether it is data for a program to crunch, or simple commands to direct the behaviour of a script, input is as
  fundamental as output.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.4.1. Getting Input from File

- Use input redirection, indicated by the `<` character, to read data from a file.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  wc < my.file
  ```

#### 1.2.4.2. Keeping Your Data with Your Script

- In the case of needing input to your script, but don't want a separate file, use a here-document with the `<<`
  characters, redirecting the text from the command line than from a file.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- In the following `ext` script, the `grep` has been parameterised by making the string that we're searching for be the
  parameter of our shell script (`$1`). Whereas we often think of `grep` as searching for a fixed string through
  various different files, here we are going to vary what we search for, but search through the same data every time.
  Rather than supplying one or more filenames to search through, we set up a here-document and tell the shell to
  redirect standard input to come from that (temporary) document. The `<<` syntax says that we want to create such a
  temporary input source, and the `EOF` is just an arbitrary string (you can choose what you like) to act as the
  terminator of the temporary input. It is not part of the input, but acts as the marker to show where it ends. The
  regular shell script (if any) resumes after the marker.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ cat ext
  #
  # here is a "here" document
  #
  grep $1 <<EOF
  Mike x.123
  Joe x.234
  Sue x.555
  Pete x.818
  Sarah x.822
  Bill x.919
  EOF

  $
  ```

#### 1.2.4.3. Preventing Weird Behaviour in a Here-Document

- Your here-document is behaving weirdly. You wanted to maintain a simple list of
donors using the method described previously for phone numbers, so you created a
file called donors that looked like this:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ cat donors
  #
  # simple lookup of our generous donors
  #
  grep $1 <<EOF
  # name amt
  Pete $100
  Joe $200
  Sam $ 25
  Bill $ 9
  EOF

  $
  ```

- But when you tried running it you got weird output:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ ./donors bill
  Pete Bill00
  bill $ 9
  $ ./donors Pete
  Pete Pete00

  $
  ```

- Turn off the shell scripting features inside the here-document by escaping any or all of the characters in the ending
  marker:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  grep $1 <<'EOF'
  Pete $100
  Joe $200
  Sam $ 25
  Bill $ 9
  EOF
  ```

- The `<<EOF` can be replaced with `<<\EOF`, or `<<'EOF'`, or even `<<E\OF` - they all work. It's not the most elegant
  syntax, but it's enough to tell `bash` that you want to treat the `here` data differently. Normally (i.e., unless you
  use this escaping syntax), says the `bash` manpage, "…all lines of the here-document are subjected to parameter
  expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion."
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- What's happening in our original donors script is that the amounts are being interpreted as shell variables. For
  example, `$100` is being seen as the shell variable `$1` followed by two zeros. That's what gives us `Pete00` when we
  search for `Pete` and `bill00` when we search for `Bill`. When we escape some or all of the characters of the EOF,
  `bash` knows not to do the expansions, and the behaviour is the expected behaviour:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ ./donors pPte
  Pete $100
  ```

- Of course, you may want the shell expansion on your data. It is a useful practice to always escape the marker, as in
  `<<'EOF'` or `<<\EOF`, to avoid unexpected results, unless you know that you really want the expansion to be done on
  your data.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Trailing whitespace (even just a single blank space) on your closing EOF marker will cause it not to be recognised as
  the closing marker. `bash` will swallow up the rest of your script, treating it as input too and looking for that
  `EOF`. Be sure there are no extra characters (especially spaces or tabs) after the `EOF`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.4.4. Indenting Here-Documents

- Use `<<-`, and then you can use tab characters (only tab characters) at the beginning of lines to indent this portion
  of your shell script.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ cat my_script.sh
  grep $1 <<-'EOF'
      lots of data
      can go here
      it's indented with tabs
      to match the script's indenting
      but the leading tabs are
      discarded when read
      EOF
  ls
  $
  ```

- The hyphen just after the `<<` is enough to tell bash to ignore the leading tab characters. This is for tab
  characters only and not arbitrary whitespace. Note that this is especially important with the `EOF` or any other
  marker designation. If you have spaces there, it will not recognise the `EOF` as your ending marker, and the `here`
  data will continue through to the end of the file (swallowing the rest of your script). Therefore, you may want to
  always left-justify the `EOF` (or other marker) just to be safe, and let the formatting go on this one line. If your
  script indents with spaces or a combination of spaces and tabs, don't use that technique on here-documents. Either
  use just tabs, or keep it all flush left. Also, watch out for text editors that automatically replace tabs with
  spaces.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.4.5. Getting User Input

- Use the read statement to get input from the user.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  read

  read -p "answer me this " ANSWER

  read -t 3 -p "answer quickly: " ANSWER

  read PRE MID POST
  ```

- A `read` statement with no arguments will read user input and place it into the shell variable `REPLY`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If you supply multiple variable names in the read statement, then `read` parses the input into words, assigning them
  in order. If the user enters fewer words, the extra variables will be set to null. If the user enters more words than
  there are variables in the `read` statement, then all of the extra words will be part of the last variable in the
  list.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.4.6. Getting a Yes or No Input

- You need to get a simple yes or no input from the user, and you want to be as user-friendly as possible. In
  particular, you do not want to be case-sensitive, and you want to provide a useful default if the user presses the
  `Enter` key.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If the actions to take are simple, use the following self-contained function:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Let the user make a choice about something and execute code based on
  # the answer
  # Called like: choose <default (y or n)> <prompt> <yes action> <no action>
  # e.g. choose "y" \
  # "Do you want to play a game?" \
  # /usr/games/GlobalThermonuclearWar \
  # 'printf "%b" "See you later Professor Falkin.\n"' >&2
  # Returns: nothing
  function choose {
    local default="$1"
    local prompt="$2"
    local choice_yes="$3"
    local choice_no="$4"
    local answer

    read -p "$prompt" answer
    [ -z "$answer" ] && answer="$default"

    case "$answer" in
      [yY1] ) eval "$choice_yes"
      # error check
      ;;
      [nN0] ) eval "$choice_no"
      # error check
      ;;
      * ) printf "%b" "Unexpected answer '$answer'!" >&2 ;;
    esac
  } # end of function choose
  ```

- If the actions are complicated, use the function in the example below and handle the results in your main code.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Let the user make a choice about something and return a standardised
  # answer. How the default is handled and what happens next is up to
  # the if/then after the choice in main.
  # Called like: choice <prompt>
  # e.g. choice "Do you want to play a game?"
  # Returns: global variable CHOICE
  function choice {
    CHOICE=''
    local prompt="$*"
    local answer

    read -p "$prompt" answer
      case "$answer" in
      [yY1] ) CHOICE='y';;
      [nN0] ) CHOICE='n';;
      * ) CHOICE="$answer";;
    esac
  } # end of function choice
  ```

- The code in the following example calls the `choice` function to prompt for and verify a package date. Assuming
  `$THISPACKAGE` is set, the function displays the date and asks for verification. If the user types `y`, `Y`, or
  presses `<Enter>`, then that date is accepted. If the user enters a new date, the function loops and verifies it.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  CHOICE=''
  until [ "$CHOICE" = "y" ]; do
    printf "%b" "This package's date is $THISPACKAGE\n" >&2

    choice "Is that correct? [Y/,<New date>]: "

    if [ -z "$CHOICE" ]; then
      CHOICE='y'
    elif [ "$CHOICE" != "y" ]; then
      printf "%b" "Overriding $THISPACKAGE with $CHOICE\n"
      THISPACKAGE=$CHOICE
    fi
  done
  ```

#### 1.2.4.7. Selecting from a List of Options

- You need to provide the user with a list of options to choose from and you don't want to make them type any more than
  necessary. Use `bash`'s builtin `select` construct to generate a menu, then have the user choose by typing the number
  of the selection.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  directorylist="Finished $(for i in /*;do [ -d "$i" ] && echo $i; done)"

  PS3='Directory to process? ' # Set a useful select prompt

  until [ "$directory" == "Finished" ]; do
    printf "%b" "\a\n\nSelect a directory to process:\n" >&2
    select directory in $directorylist; do
      # User types a number which is stored in $REPLY, but select
      # returns the value of the entry
      if [ "$directory" == "Finished" ]; then
        echo "Finished processing directories."
        break
      elif [ -n "$directory" ]; then
        echo "You chose number $REPLY, processing $directory..."
        # Do something here
        break
      else
        echo "Invalid selection!"
      fi # end of handle user's selection
    done # end of select a directory
  done # end of until dir == finished
  ```

- The select statement makes it trivial to present a numbered list to the user on `STDERR`, from which they may make a
  choice. Don't forget to provide an "exit" or "finished" choice, though `<Ctrl> + d` will end the `select` and empty
  input will print the menu again.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The number the user typed is returned in `$REPLY`, and the value of that entry is returned in the variable you
  specified in the `select` construct.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.4.8. Prompting for a Password

- Use the `read` command to read the user's input, but with a special option to turn off echoing.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The `-s` option tells the `read` command not to echo the characters typed (`s` is for silent) and the `-p` option
  says that the next argument is the prompt to be displayed prior to reading input. The line of input that is read from
  the user is put into the variable named `$PASSWD`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- With echoing disabled, when the user presses the Enter key no new line is echoed and any subsequent output would
  appear on the same line as the prompt. Printing the new line gets us to the next line, as you would expect.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If you read a password into an environment variable it is in memory in plain text, and thus may be accessed via a
  core dump or `/proc/core` (if your OS provides `/proc/`). It is also in the process environment, which may be
  accessible by other processes. You may be better off using certificates with SSH, if possible. In any case, it is
  wise to assume that root and possibly other users on the machine may gain access to the password, so you should
  handle the situation accordingly.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

### 1.2.5. Executing Commands

- The main purpose of `bash` (or of any shell) is to allow you to interact with the computer's operating system so that
  you can accomplish whatever you need to do. Usually that involves launching programs, so the shell takes the commands
  you type, determines from that input what programs need to be run, and launches them for you.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.5.1. Running Any Executable

- Use `bash` and type the name of the command at the user input prompt when you need to run a command on a Linux or
  Unix system. This is simple on a surface level, but there are a lot of steps going on behind the scenes. The basic
  operation in `bash` is to load and execute programs. All the additional functionality provided by `bash` is to enable
  and facilitate the execution of programs.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `bash` uses a shell variable called `$PATH` to locate your executable. The `$PATH` variable is a list of directories.
  The directories are separated by colons. `bash` searches in each of those directories for a file with the name that
  you specified. `bash` looks at the order in which the directories are listed in the variable, and takes the first
  executable found.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ echo $PATH
  /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:.

  $
  ```

- The last directory in the list is just a single dot (called the dot directory, or just dot), which represents the
  current directory on a Linux or Unix filesystem - wherever you are, that's the directory to which dot refers.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Putting dot in the `$PATH` is too great a security risk - someone could trick you and get you to run their own
  malicious version of a command (say, `ls`) in place of one that you were expecting. If dot were listed first, then
  someone else's version of `ls` would supersede the normal `ls` command, and you would likely unwittingly run that
  command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If you put dot as the last directory in your `$PATH` variable, at least you won't be tricked that easily. Of course,
  if you leave it off altogether it is arguably even safer, and you can still run commands in your local directory by
  typing a leading dot and slash character.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  ./my_script
  ```

- Never allow dot or writeable directories in root's `$PATH`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- A common practice among some `bash` users is to create a personal `bin` directory, analogous to the system
  directories `/bin` and `/usr/bin` where executables are kept. In your personal bin (if you create it in your `home`
  directory, its path is `~/bin`) you can put copies of your favourite shell scripts and other customised or private
  commands. Then add that directory to your `$PATH`, even to the front (`PATH=~/bin:$PATH`). That way, you can still
  have your own customised favourites without the security risk of running commands from strangers.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.5.2. Running Several Commands in Sequence

- There are two solutions to running several commands before manually inputting the next command after a successful
  execution of the previous command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - A shell script could be written to contain the commands order by the sequence of execution
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    $ cat > simple.script
    long
    medium
    short
    ^D # <Ctrl> + d, not visible
    $ bash ./simple.script
    ```

  - The arguably best solution is to run each command in sequence without a script.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    - If you want to run each program regardless of whether or not the preceding ones fail, separate them with
      semicolons.
      [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    long ; medium ; short
    ```

    - If you only want to run the next program if the previous program was successful, and all the programs correctly
      set exit codes.
      [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    long && medium && short
    ```

#### 1.2.5.3. Running Several Commands All at Once

- You can run a command in the background by putting an ampersand at the end of the command line. Thus, you could
  fire off three commands in rapid succession.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ long &
  [1] 4592

  $ medium &
  [2] 4593

  $ short

  $
  ```

- You could streamline the execution of all three commands in one line.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ long & medium & short
  [1] 4592
  [2] 4593

  $
  ```

- When we run a command "in the background" (there really is no such place in Linux), all that really means is that we
  disconnect keyboard input from the command and the shell doesn't wait for the command to complete before it gives
  another prompt and accepts more command input. Output from the command (unless we take explicit action to change this
  behaviour) will still come to the screen, so in this example all three commands will be interspersing output to the
  screen.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If you run a command and then realise it will take longer to complete than you thought, you can pause it using
  `<Ctrl> + z`, which will return you to a prompt. You can then type `bg` to unpause the job and continue running it in
  the background. This is essentially adding a trailing `&` after the fact.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.5.4. Telling Whether a Command Succeeded or Not

- The shell variable `$?` is set with a non-zero value if the command fails - provided the programmer who wrote that
  command or shell script followed the established convention.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ some_command
  # it works...

  $ echo $?
  0

  $ bad_command
  # it fails...

  $ echo $?
  1

  $
  ```

- The exit status of a command is kept in the shell variable referenced with `$?`. Its value can range from 0 to 255.
  When you write a shell script, it's a good idea to have your script exit with zero if all is well and a non-zero
  value if you encounter an error condition. It it recommended to only use `0 to 127` because the shell uses `128+N` to
  denote `killed by signal N`. if you use a number greater than 255 or less than 0, the numbers will wrap around. You
  return an exit status with the exit statement (e.g., `exit 1` or `exit 0`).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Be aware that you only get one shot at reading a command's exit status. The second `echo` gives `0` as a result, as
  it's actually reporting on the status of the immediately preceding `echo` command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ bad_command
  # it fails...

  $ echo $?
  1

  $ echo $?
  0

  $
  ```

- As a result of the fact you only get one chance to check the exit status, many shell scripts will immediately assign
  the status to another shell variable.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ bad_command
  # it fails...

  $ STAT=$?

  $ echo $STAT
  1

  $ echo $STAT
  1

  $
  ```

- Although the examples shown in this section are in the command line, the real use of variables like `$?` comes in
  writing scripts. You can usually see whether or not a command has been successful by watching it execute on your
  screen, but in a script the commands may be running unattended. The `exit` status is more often used in scripts, and
  often in `if` statements, to take different actions depending on the success or failure of a command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  some_command
  ...
  if (( $? )) ; then echo failed ; else echo OK; fi
  ```

- You should not use negative numbers for status codes. The shell with accept them without an error, but they will lead
  to unexpected behaviour.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ bash -c 'exit -2' ; echo $?
  254

  $ bash -c 'exit -200' ; echo $?
  56
  ```

#### 1.2.5.5. Running a Command Only if Another Command Succeeded

- You need to run some commands, but you only want to run certain commands if certain other ones succeed. You can use
  the exit status (`$?`) of the first command in combination with an `if` statement to do the subsequent command only
  if the first command was successful.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  cd dir_name
  if (( $? == 0 )); then rm * ; fi
  ```

- If you're writing `bash` scripts, you'll want to be sure to explicitly set return values, so that `$?` is set
  properly from your script. If you don't, the value set will be the value of the last command run, which you may not
  want as your result.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.5.6. Using Fewer `if` Statements

- If you want to be thorough about your error checking, but don't want `if` statements all over the place in a script,
  you can have `bash` exit any time it encounters a failure (i.e., a non‐zero exit status) from every command in your
  script (except in `while` loops and `if` statements where it is already capturing and using the exit status) by
  setting the `-e` flag.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  set -e
  cd temp_dir
  rm *
  ```

- Setting the `-e` flag in the previous example will cause the shell to exit when a command fails. If the `cd` in this
  example fails, the script will exit and never even try to execute the `rm *` command. You should not do this on an
  interactive shell, however, because when the shell exits it will make your shell window go away.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.5.7. Running Long Jobs Unattended

- If you want to run a job in the background and expect to exit the shell before the job
  completes, then you need to `nohup` the job.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ nohup long &
  nohup: appending output to `nohup.out'

  $
  ```

- When you put a job in the background (via the &, as described in
  [1.2.5.3. Running Several Command All at Once](#1253-running-several-commands-all-at-once)), it is still a child
  process of the `bash` shell. When you exit an instance of the shell, bash sends a hangup (`hup`) signal to all of its
  child processes.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The `nohup` command simply sets up the child process to ignore hangup signals. You can still kill the job with the
  `kill` command, because `kill` sends a `SIGTERM` signal, not a `SIGHUP` signal. But with `nohup`, `bash` won't
  inadvertently kill your job when you exit.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `nohup` redirects the output for you, appending it (not overwriting, but adding at the end) to a file named
  `nohup.out` in the current directory. You can explicitly redirect the output elsewhere on the command line, and
  `nohup` is smart enough to detect that this has happened and not use `nohup.out` for your output.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.5.8. Displaying Error Messages When Failures Occur

- A common idiom among some shell programmers is to use the `||` with commands to spit out debug or error messages,
  saving the necessity to write too many `if` statements.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  cmd || printf "%b" "cmd failed. You're on your own\n"
  ```

- Similar to how the `&&` in [1.2.5.6. Using Fewer `if` Statements](#1256-using-fewer-if-statements) tells `bash` not
  to bother to evaluate the second expression if the first one is false, the `||` tells the shell not to bother to
  evaluate the second expression if the first one is true (i.e., succeeds). Only if the first expression returns a
  non-zero value (i.e., if the exit value of the command indicates failure) must it evaluate the second part, and thus
  run the other command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The exit will be executed in either case in the following example.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  cmd || printf "%b" "FAILED.\n" ; exit 1
  ```

- The `OR` is only between the first two commands in the previous example. If we want to have the `exit` happen only on
  error, we need to group it with the `printf` so that both are considered as a unit.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  cmd || { printf "%b" "FAILED.\n" ; exit 1 ; }
  ```

#### 1.2.5.9. Running Commands from a Variable

- You want to run different commands in your script depending on circumstances, you can assign the program name to a
  variable (`$PROG` in the following example) , and then when the variable is referred to where a command name would be
  expected, `bash` uses the name of that variable as the command to run. It parses the command line, substitutes the
  values of its variables, and takes the result of all the substitutions and treats that as the command line, as if it
  had been typed that way verbatim.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  FN=/tmp/x.x
  PROG=echo
  $PROG $FN

  PROG=cat
  $PROG $FN
  ```

- There are many other possible solutions to this problem, other than the code in the previous example.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Be careful about the variable names you use, ensuring the variable names are not used by other programs.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.5.10. Running All Scripts in a Directory

- If you want to run a series of scripts, but the list keeps changing; you're always adding new scripts, but you don't
  want to continuously modify a master list, put the scripts you want to run in a directory, and let `bash` run
  everything that it finds. Instead of keeping a master list, simply use the contents of that directory as your master
  list.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  for SCRIPT in /path/to/scripts/dir/*
  do
    if [ -f "$SCRIPT" -a -x "$SCRIPT" ]
    then
      $SCRIPT
    fi
  done
  ```

- There are no means to specify any arguments to the scripts as they are executed. This simple script may work well for
  your personal needs, but wouldn't be considered robust; some might consider it downright dangerous.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

### 1.2.6. Basic Scripting: Shell Variables

- `bash` shell programming is a lot like any kind of programming, and that includes having variables - containers that
  hold strings and numbers, which can be changed, compared, and passed around. `bash` variables have some very special
  operators that can be used when you refer to a variable. `bash` also has some important builtin variables, ones that
  provide important information about the other variables in your script.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- There are two significant aspects of `bash` variable syntax that may not be intuitively obvious. First, in the
  assignment, the `name=value` syntax is straightforward enough, but there cannot be any spaces around the equals sign.
  The flip side of this is also worth noting - don't use an equals sign in a filename, especially not one for a shell
  script (it is possible, just not recommended).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The second aspect of shell variable syntax worth noting is the use of the dollar sign when referring to a variable.
  You don't use the dollar sign on the variable name to assign it a value, but you do use the dollar sign to get the
  value of the variable. The exception to this is using variables inside a `$(( ))` expression.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Since everything in `bash` is a string, we need the dollar sign to indicate a variable reference.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.6.1. Embedding Documentation in Shell Scripts

- Embed documentation in the script using the "do nothing" builtin (a colon) and a here-document, when you want a
  simple way to provide formatted end-user documentation (e.g., manpages or HTML pages) for your script.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash

  echo 'Shell script code goes here'

  # Use a : NOOP and here document to embed documentation,
  : <<'END_OF_DOCS'

  Embedded documentation such as Perl's Plain Old Documentation (POD), or even plain text here.

  Any accurate documentation is better than none at all.

  =head1 NAME

  MY~PROGRAM--One-line description here

  =head1 SYNOPSIS

    MY~PROGRAM [OPTIONS] <file>

  =head1 OPTIONS

    -h = This usage.
    -v = Be verbose.
    -V = Show version, copyright, and license information.

  =head1 DESCRIPTION

  A full description of the application and its features. May include numerous subsections (i.e., =head2, =head3, etc.)

  [...]

  =head1 LICENSE AND COPYRIGHT

  =cut

  END_OF_DOCS
  ```

- To extract and use the documentation from the previous example, enter the following commands.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # To read on-screen, automatically paginated
  $ perldoc my_script

  # Just the "usage" sections
  $ pod2usage my_script

  # Create an HTML version
  $ pod2html my_script > my_script.html

  # Create a manpage
  $ pod2man my_script > my_script.1
  ```

- Any plain-text documentation or markup can be used this way, either interspersed throughout the code, or better yet,
  collected at the end of the script. Since computer systems that have bash will probably also have Perl, its Plain Old
  Documentation (POD) format may be a good choice. Perl usually comes with `pod2*` programs to convert POD to HTML,
  LaTeX, manpage, text, and usage files.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.6.2. Promoting Script Readability

- Follow these best practices when you would like to make your script as readable as possible for the ease of
  understanding and future maintenance.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Document your script as noted in [1.2.6.1. Embedding Documentation in Shell Scripts](
    #1261-embedding-documentation-in-shell-scripts). Document your intent, not the trivial details of the code. If you
    follow the rest of the points, the code should be pretty clear. Write reminders, provide sample data layouts or
    headers, and make a note of all the details that are in your head now, as you write the code. Document the code
    itself too if it is subtle or obscure.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Indent and use vertical whitespace wisely. Ensure a consistent indentation level throughout the script. Add
    additional indentation for continued lines.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Use meaningful names for variables and functions, and spell them out. The only time `$i` or `$x` is ever
    acceptable is in a `for` loop. You may think that short, cryptic names are saving you time and typing now, but it
    is guaranteed that you will lose that time 10- or 100-fold somewhere down the line when you have to fix or modify
    your script.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Break lines at meaningful places at an agreed upon line length. Unfortunately, there are sometimes exceptions to
    the long line rule. When creating lines to pass elsewhere, perhaps via Secure Shell (SSH), and in certain other
    cases, breaking up the line can cause many more code headaches than it solves. But in most cases, it makes sense.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Try to put the most meaningful bits to the left when you break a line - we tend to read shell code left-to-right,
    so the unusual fact of a continued line will stand out more. It's also easier to scan down the left edge of the
    code for continued lines, should you need to find them.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Good
  [ -n "$results" ] \
    && echo "Got a good result in $results" \
    || echo 'Got an empty result, something is wrong'

  # Also good
  [ -n "$results" ] && echo "Got a good result in $results" \
                    || echo 'Got an empty result, something is wrong'

  # OK, but not ideal
  [ -n "$results" ] && echo "Got a good result in $results" \
    || echo 'Got an empty result, something is wrong'

  # Bad
  [ -n "$results" ] && echo "Got a good result in $results" || \
  echo 'Got an empty result, something is wrong'

  # Bad (trailing \s are optional here, but recommended for clarity)
  [ -n "$results" ] && \
  echo "Got a good result in $results" || \
  echo 'Got an empty result, something is wrong'
  ```

#### 1.2.6.3. Separating Variable Names from Surrounding Text

- Use the full syntax for a variable reference, which includes not just the dollar sign, but also braces around the
  variable name when you need to print a variable along with other text and need to distinguish the end of the variable
  name from other text that follows.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- An example without the full syntax without a variable name.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  for FN in 1 2 3 4 5
  do
    some_script /tmp/rep$FNport.txt
  done
  ```

- An example without the full syntax without a variable name.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  for FN in 1 2 3 4 5
  do
    some_script /tmp/rep${FN}port.txt
  done
  ```

- Because shell variables can contain only alphanumeric characters and the underscore, there are many instances where
  you won't need to use the braces. Any whitespace or punctuation (except the underscore) provides enough of a clue to
  where the variable name ends. But when in doubt, use the braces. In fact, some people would argue that always using
  the braces is a good habit so you never have to worry about when they are needed or not, and provides a consistent
  look throughout your scripts. Others find that to be too much typing of characters that are optional but awkward to
  reach, and think they can make the code look very busy or noisy. Ultimately, it's a matter of personal preference.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.6.4. Exporting Variables

- Export variables that you want to pass on to other scripts.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  export MY_VAR
  export NAME=value
  ```

- Sometimes it's a good thing that one script doesn't know about the other script's variables. You wouldn't want a
  script to impact the execution of another script.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Sometimes you do want the information passed along. In those cases, you can export the variable so that its value is
  passed along to any other program that the script invokes.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If you want to see a list of all the exported variables, just type the command `env` (or use the builtin `export -p`)
  for a list of each variable and its value.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You can make the `export` part of any variable assignment, though that won't work in old versions of the shell. You
  can also have the `export` statement just name the variable that will be exported. Though the export statement can be
  put anywhere prior to where you need the value to be exported, script writers often group these statements together,
  like variable declarations, at the top of a script.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Once exported, you can assign repeatedly to the variable without exporting it each time. The following is an example
  of this.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  export F_NAME
  export SIZE
  export MAX
  ...
  MAX=2048
  SIZE=64
  F_NAME=/tmp/scratch
  ```

- The following is another example.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  export F_NAME=/tmp/scratch
  export SIZE=64
  export MAX=2048
  ...
  F_NAME=/tmp/scratch2
  ...
  F_NAME=/tmp/still_exported
  ```

- The exported variables are, in effect, call by value. Changing the value of the exported variable in the called
  script does not change that variable's value back in the calling script.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.6.5. Seeing All Variable Values

- Use the `set` command to see the values of all variables and function definitions in the current shell.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Use the `env` (or `export -p`) command to see only those variables that have been exported and would be available to
  a subshell. The list produced by `env` is a subset of the list produced by set, since not all variables are exported.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- In `bash` version 4 or newer, you can also use the `declare -p` command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The output from the newer `declare -p` command shows the variable names and values as if they were being declared and
  initialised. The output is in the form of `declare` statements that could be used as source code in a shell script to
  recreate these variables and their values. The various arguments (`-i`, `-x`, `-r`, `-a`) indicate that the variable
  is an integer, has been exported, is read-only, or is an array, respectively.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ declare -p
  ...
  declare -i MY_COUNT="5"
  declare -x MY_ENV="10.5.1.2"
  declare -r MY_FIXED="unchangeable"
  declare -a MYRA=([0]="5" [1]="10" [2]="15")
  ...

  $
  ```

#### 1.2.6.6. Using Parameters in a Shell Script

- Use command line parameters when you want users to be able to invoke your script with a parameter. It is a more
  straightforward solution than requiring users to set a shell variable, or pass data with another script.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You don't need the braces for the single-digit numbers, except to separate the variable name from the surrounding
  text. Typical scripts have only a handful of parameters, but when you get to `${10}` you need to use the braces
  because the shell will interpret `$10` as `${1}` followed immediately by the literal string `0`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ cat tricky.sh
  echo $1 $10 ${10}

  $ ./tricky.sh I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI
  I I0 X

  $
  ```

#### 1.2.6.7. Looping Over Arguments Passed to a Script

- You may want to use the shell pattern matching to build a list of filenames that match the `*.txt` pattern. This
  means that any number of arguments could be passed to the script to which you are passing the arguments.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  ./act_all *.txt
  ```

- To process any number of command line arguments that cannot be set strictly, use the shell special variable `$*` to
  refer to all of your arguments, and use that in a `for` loop. The `for` loop will take the first value from the list,
  assign it to the variable `$FN`, and proceed through the list of statements between the `do` and the `done.` It will
  then repeat that loop for each of the other values.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # change permissions on a bunch of files

  for FN in $*
  do
    echo changing $FN
    chmod 0750 $FN
  done
  ```

#### 1.2.6.8. Handling Parameters with Spaces

- If we don't put quotes around the filename when we invoke the script, `bash` sees three arguments and substitutes the
  first argument (`Oh`) for `$1`. The `ls` command runs with `Oh` as its only argument and can't find that file.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ cat simple.sh
  # simple shell script
  ls -l ${1}

  $

  $ ./simple.sh Oh the Waste
  ls: Oh: No such file or directory

  $
  ```

- Putting quotes around the file name when invoking the script does not resolve the issue, as the script means `ls`
  sees each word as a separate argument, meaning it can't find any of them.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ ./simple.sh "Oh the Waste"
  ls: Oh: No such file or directory
  ls: the: No such file or directory
  ls: Waste: No such file or directory

  $
  ```

- Putting quotes around the variable reference ensure `ls` treats the `"${1}"` is treated as a single argument.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ cat quoted.sh
  # note the quotes
  ls -l "${1}"

  $

  $ ./quoted.sh "Oh the Waste"
  -rw-r--r-- 1 smith users 28470 2007-01-11 19:22 Oh the Waste

  $
  ```

#### 1.2.6.9. Handling Lists of Parameters with Spaces

- The `"$*"` in the following script used in the `for` loop fails does not provided the expected behaviour when
  processing a file with a space in its name.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  for FN in "$*"
  do
    chmod 0750 "$FN"
  done
  ```

- The unexpected behaviour is caused by the `"$*"` in the script, used in the `for` loop. For this case we need to use
  a different but related shell variable, `$@`. When it is quoted, the resulting list has quotes around each argument
  separately.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # change permissions on a bunch of files
  # with better quoting in case of filenames with spaces
  #
  for FN in "$@"
  do
    chmod 0750 "$FN"
  done
  ```

- You should generally always use a `$@` in any `for` loops that iterate through an array. When you know your file
  names (or parameters in general) don't have spaces, it's okay to keep the traditional `$*` syntax. For more robust
  scripting, the `$@` is the safer option. Both options will be used interchangeably throughout this book, as that
  was more familiar to the authors.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.6.10. Counting Arguments

- Use the shell builtin variable `$#` to determine how many parameters a script was invoked with.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # Check for the correct # of arguments:
  # Use this syntax or use: if [ $# -lt 3 ]

  if (( $# < 3 ))
  then
    printf "%b" "Error. Not enough arguments.\n" >&2
    printf "%b" "usage: my_script file1 op file2\n" >&2
    exit 1
  elif (( $# > 3 ))
  then
    printf "%b" "Error. Too many arguments.\n" >&2
    printf "%b" "usage: my_script file1 op file2\n" >&2
    exit 2
  else
    printf "%b" "Argument count correct. Proceeding...\n"
  fi
  ```

- The following is an example usage of the previous script, once with too many arguments and once with the correct
  number of arguments.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ ./my_script my_file is copied into your_file
  Error. Too many arguments.
  usage: my_script file1 op file2

  $ ./my_script my_file copy your_file
  Argument count correct. Proceeding...
  ```

- Don't confuse `${#}` with `${#VAR}` or even `${VAR#alt}` just because they all use the hash character inside of
  curly braces. The first gives the number of arguments, whereas the second gives the length of the value in the
  variable `VAR` and the third does a certain kind of substitution.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.6.11. Consuming Arguments

- Use `shift` to remove an argument after you've handled it.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # use and consume an option
  # parse the optional argument

  VERBOSE=0
  if [[ $1 = -v ]]
  then
    VERBOSE=1
    shift
  fi

  #
  # the real work is here
  #
  for FN in "$@"
  do
    if (( VERBOSE == 1 ))
    then
      echo changing $FN
    fi
      chmod 0750 "$FN"
  done
  ```

#### 1.2.6.12. Getting Default Values

- Use the `${:-}` syntax when referring to a parameter that you would like to have a default value, and use it to
  supply a default value. The `:-` operator says that if the specified parameter (here, `$1`) is not set or is `null`,
  whatever follows (`/tmp` in our example) should be used as the value. Otherwise, it will use the value that is
  already set. It can be used on any shell variable, not just the positional parameters (`$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc.),
  but they are probably the most common use.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  FILE_DIR=${1:-/tmp}
  ```

#### 1.2.6.13. Setting Default Values

- Your script relies on certain environment variables, either widely used ones (e.g., `$USER`) or ones specific to your
  own business. If you want to build a robust shell script, you should make sure that these variables each have a
  reasonable value. Use the assignment operator in the shell variable reference the first time you refer to it to
  assign a value to the variable if it doesn't already have one.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The reference to `$HOME` in the example will return the current value of `$HOME` unless it is empty or not set at
  all. In those cases (empty or not set), it will return the value `/tmp`, which will also be assigned to `$HOME` so
  that further references to `$HOME` will have this new value.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ echo ${HOME:=/tmp}
  /home/uid002

  $ unset HOME # Generally not wise to do.

  $ echo ${HOME:=/tmp}
  /tmp

  $ echo $HOME
  /tmp

  $ cd && pwd
  /tmp

  $
  ```

- Once we unset the variable in the previous example, it no longer had any value. When we then used the `:=` operator
  as part of our reference to it, the new value (`/tmp`) was substituted. The subsequent references to `$HOME` returned
  its new value. One important exception to keep in mind about the assignment operator: this mechanism will not work
  with positional parameter arguments (e.g., `$1` or `$*`). For those cases, use `:-` in expressions like
  `${1:-default`}, which will return the value without trying to do the assignment.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- It might help you to remember some of these crazy symbols if you think of the visual difference between
  `${VAR:=value}` and `${VAR:-value}`. The `:=` will do an assignment as well as returning the value to the right of
  the operator. The `:-` will do half of that - it returns the value but doesn't do the assignment - so its symbol is
  only half of an equals sign (i.e., one horizontal bar, not two).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.6.14. Using `null` as Valid Default Value

- The `${:=}` operator has two cases where the new value will be used: first, when the value of the shell variable has
  previously not been set (or has been explicitly unset); and second, where the value has been set but is empty, as in
  `HOME=""` or `HOME=$OTHER` (where `$OTHER` has no value).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The shell can distinguish between the two cases in the previous point, and omitting the colon (`:`) indicates that
  you want to make the substitution only if the value is unset. If you write only `${HOME=/tmp}` without the colon,
  the assignment will take place only in the case where the variable is not set (never set or explicitly unset).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- In the case where we simply made the `$HOME` variable an empty string, the `=` operator didn't do the substitution
  since `$HOME` did have a value, albeit `null`. But when we unset the variable, the substitution occurred. If you
  want to allow for empty strings, use just the `=` with no colon. Most times, though, the `:=` is used because you can
  do little with an empty value, deliberate or not.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ echo ${HOME=/tmp} # no substitution needed
  /home/uid002

  $ HOME=""
  # generally not wise

  $ echo ${HOME=/tmp} # will NOT substitute
  $ unset HOME
  # generally not wise

  $ echo ${HOME=/tmp}
  # will substitute
  /tmp

  $ echo $HOME
  /tmp

  $
  ```

#### 1.2.6.15. Using More than Just a Constant String for Default

- You can use quite a bit more on the right-hand side of these shell variable references. The value that will be
  substituted doesn't have to be just a `string` constant. Rather, it can be the result of a more complex shell
  expression, including running commands in a subshell (as in the following example).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  cd ${BASE:="$(pwd)"}
  ```

- The `bash` manpage says that what we put to the right of the operator "is subject to tilde expansion, parameter
  expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion."
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - **Parameter expansion**:

    - Means that other shell variables can be used in the expression, as in `${BASE:=${HOME}}`
      [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - **Tilde Expansion**:

    - Using an expression like `~bob` will refer to the home directory of the user `bob`.
      [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    - Use `${BASE:=~uid17}` to set the default value to the home directory for the user `uid17`. Don't put quotes
      around the string, as that will defeat the tilde expansion.
      [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - **Command Substitution**:

    - Commands are enclosed in the single parentheses syntax, `$(commands)`.
      [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - **Arithmetic Expansion**:

    - Means that we can do integer arithmetic, using `$(())` syntax in this expression.
      [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    - For example: `echo ${BASE:=/home/uid$((ID+1))}`
      [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.6.16. Giving an Error Message for Unset Parameters

- sometimes you need to force the users to give you a value; otherwise, you don't want to proceed. Instead of several
  `if` statements to check each of the several parameters, use the `${:?}` syntax when referring to the parameters.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  USAGE="usage: my_script scratch_dir source_file conversion"
  FILE_DIR=${1:?"Error. You must supply a scratch directory."}
  FILE_SRC=${2:?"Error. You must supply a source file."}
  CVT_TYPE=${3:?"Error. ${USAGE}"}
  ```

- If you run the script with insufficient arguments:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ ./my_script /tmp /dev/null
  ./my_script: line 7: 3: Error. usage: my_script scratch_dir source_file conversion

  $
  ```

- The error message produced by the ${:?} feature includes shell script filename and line number.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ ./check_unset_params
  ./check_unset_params: line 5: 1: Error. You must supply a scratch directory.

  $ ./check_unset_params some_dir
  /tmp/check_unset_params: line 6: 2: Error. You must supply a source file.

  $ ./check_unset_params some_dir some_file
  ./check_unset_params: line 7: 3: Error. usage: my_script scratch_dir source_file \
  conversion
  ```

#### 1.2.6.17. Changing Pieces of a String

- Use a `bash` parameter expansion feature that will remove text that matches a pattern. The `for` loop will iterate
  over a list of filenames in the current directory that all end in `.bad`. The variable `$FN` will take the value of
  each name, one at a time. Inside the loop, the `mv` command will rename the file (move it from the old name to the
  new name). We need to put quotes around each filename in case the filename contains embedded spaces.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  #
  # rename files that end in .bad to be .bash
  for FN in *.bad
  do
    mv "${FN}" "${FN%bad}bash"
  done
  ```

- In both the previous and following example, the reference to $FN that includes an automatic deletion of the trailing
  bad characters. The `${ }` delimits the reference so that the `bash` adjacent to it is just appended right onto the
  end of the string.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  NO_BAD="${FN%bad}"
  NEW_NAME="${NO_BAD}bash"
  mv "${FN}" "${NEW_NAME}"
  ```

#### 1.2.6.18. Getting the Absolute Value of a Number

- Use string manipulation when you have a numeric value in a variable and want to determine its magnitude - its
  absolute value.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- This is simple string manipulation. The `#` searches from the front of the string, looking for, in this case, the
  minus sign. If found, it will remove it. If no minus is found, it simply results in the original value. Either way,
  that leaves the value without a leading minus, which gives us its magnitude.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  ${MY_VAR#-}
  ```

#### 1.2.6.19. Using `bash` for `basename`

- `bash` can strip the directory path from a shell variable string and leave just the last part of the path (the
  filename), providing the same output as `basename`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The big difference between the first and second examples is the braces. The first example, using parentheses, will
  launch a subshell to run the executable `basename` with the argument that is the value of `$FULL_PATH_TO_FILE`. The
  second example uses curly braces, which is just part of the syntax for evaluating a shell variable - no subshell, no
  executable file. It looks for, and removes from the front of the string (because of the `#`), the longest match
  (because of the double `##`) of the pattern described by the asterisk and the slash (`*/`). The asterisk matches any
  number of characters and the slash is just a literal slash. In the string `/usr/local/bin/my_cmd`, that pattern will
  match (and thus remove) the `/usr/local/bin/` part of the string, leaving `my_cmd` as the value to be assigned into
  the variable `$FILE`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # basename Solution
  FILE=$(basename $FULL_PATH_TO_FILE)

  # bash Solution
  FILE=${FULL_PATH_TO_FILE##*/}
  ```

- The `basename` command will ignore a trailing slash in the path, so `$(basename /usr/local/bin/)` returns `bin`
  whereas our `bash` version would return an empty string (since the largest pattern to end in a slash is the whole
  string). To be compatible, we should remove any trailing slash first before the other substitutions. The real
  `basename` command can also take a suffix to be removed as a second argument. In `bash` we can do that, too, but
  would need to do it in a separate step.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.6.20. Using `bash` for `dirname`

- Use a string manipulation operator to remove the filename - the last part of a path in a string - leaving as much of
  the directory path to that filename as was in the string, producing the same output as the `dirname` command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If the variable holds `/usr/local/bin/my_cmd`, we want the result of this manipulation to give us just
  `/usr/local/bin` and drop the last part (the filename). Since each piece of the path is separated by a slash, we just
  remove from the right-hand side (because of the `%`) the shortest string (because there is only one `%`, not two) that
  matches the pattern "a slash followed by any number of characters" (`\*`).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # dirname Solution
  DIR=$(dirname $MY_PATH_TO_FILE)

  # bash Solution
  DIR=${MY_PATH_TO_FILE%/*}
  ```

- The example in this section is not a complete, compatible replacement for the `dirname` command, especially around
  the edge cases of any path that ends with a slash.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.6.21. Using Alternate Values for Comma-Separated Values

- If you write `LIST="$\{LIST\},$\{NEW_VAL\}"` inside a loop to build up the list, then the first time (when `LIST`
  is `null`) you'll end up with a leading comma. You could special-case the initialisation of `LIST` so that it gets
  the first element before entering the loop, but if that's not practical, or to avoid duplicate code (for getting a
  new value), you can instead use the `${:+}` syntax in `bash`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  LIST="${LIST}${LIST:+,}${NEW_VAL}"
  ```

- If `$\{LIST\}` is `null` or unset, then both expressions of `$LIST` are replaced with nothing. That means that the
  first time through the loop `LIST` will be assigned `NEW_VAL`'s value and nothing more. When `LIST` is not null, the
  second expression (`${LIST:+,}`) is replaced with a comma, separating the previous value from the new value.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #
  # read names one at a time
  # and build a comma-separated list
  #
  while read NEW_VAL
  do
  LIST="${LIST}${LIST:+,}${NEW_VAL}"
  done
  echo $LIST
  ```

#### 1.2.6.22. Using Array Variables

- `bash` has an array syntax for single-dimension arrays. Arrays are easy to initialise if you know the values as you
  write the script. The format is simple. Each element of the array is a separate word in the list, enclosed in
  parentheses.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  MYRA=(first second third home)
  echo runners on ${MYRA[0]} and ${MYRA[2]}
  ```

- If you write only `$MYRA` in the previous example, you will get only the first element, just as if you had written
  `${MYRA[0]}`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.6.23. Converting Between Upper- and Lower-case

- As of `bash` 4.0, there are a few operators to do case conversion when referencing a variable name.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  ${FN,,} # Returns the string in all lower-case.
  ${FN^^} # Returns the string in all upper-case.
  ${FN~~} # Returns the string, changing all lower- to upper- and all upper- to lower-case characters.
  ```

- Also available in version 4 of `bash` or newer: you can declare your variable to be a type that is always lower-case,
  upper-case, or only ensuring the first character is upper-case.
  Any text assigned to it will be converted to lower-case.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  declare -u <variable_name> # All characters upper-case.
  declare -l <variable_name> # All  lower-case.
  declare -c <variable_name> # Only the first character upper-case.
  ```

#### 1.2.6.24. Converting to Camel Case

- Use a combination of an array and case conversion substitution if you want each word to begin with a capital letter,
  not just the first letter of the string.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The parentheses around `$XT` cause it to be treated as array initialisation. Whitespace separating the words
  delineates the array elements. The `[@]` notation references all the elements of the array all at once
  (individually), and the `^` operator converts the first character (of each element) to upper-case.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  while read TXT
  do
    RA=($TXT) # Must be ($ not $(
    echo ${RA[@]^}
  done
  ```

### 1.2.7. Shell Logic & Arithmetic

- One of the big improvements in modern versions of `bash` compared with the original Bourne shell is in the area of
  arithmetic. Early versions of the shell had no builtin arithmetic; it had to be done by invoking a separate
  executable.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Beyond arithmetic, there are the control structures familiar to any programmer. There is an `if/then/else` construct
  for decision making, as well as `while` loops and `for` loops, though you will see some `bash` peculiarities to all
  of these. There is a case statement made quite powerful by its string pattern matching, and an odd construct called
  `select`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.7.1. Doing Arithmetic in Your Shell Script

- Use `$(( ))` or `let` for integer arithmetic expressions.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  COUNT=$((COUNT + 5 + MAX * 2))
  let COUNT+='5+MAX*2'
  ```

- You can use all the C-like operators inside of `$(())` for arithmetic expressions.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Spaces are not needed, nor are they prohibited around operators and arguments.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You must also ensure to quote `let` expressions since the `let` statement is a `bash` builtin and its arguments will
  undergo word expansion.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- There is one additional operator: you can use `**` for raising to a power.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  MAX=$((2**8))
  ```

#### 1.2.7.2. Branching on Conditions

- Thee general form for an `if` statement, from the manpage for `bash` is, where contents in `[]` are optional parts of
  the statements:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  if list; then list; [ elif list; then list; ] ... [ else list; ] fi
  ```

- Properly-written commands and builtins return a value of `0` (zero) when they encounter no errors in their execution.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If commands and builtins detect an error (e.g., bad parameters, I/O errors, file not found), they will return some
  non-zero value (often a different value for each kind of error they detect).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `if` statements support two kinds of syntax. The double parentheses are strictly for arithmetic expressions. The
  square brackets test for file characteristics, but the syntax is much less streamlined for arithmetic expressions.
  This is particularly true if you need to group larger expressions with parentheses (which need to be quotes or
  escaped when using square brackets).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.7.3. Testing for File Characteristics

- There are several characteristics for which you can test a file. Three of them are tested using binary operators,
  each taking two filenames.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Is newer than (checking the modification date). An existing file is considered "newer" than one that doesn't exist.
  $FILE1 -nt $FILE2

  # Is older than. A file that doesn't exist is considered older than one that does.
  $FILE1 -ot $FILE2

  # Have the same device and inode numbers, meaning they are identical numbers, even it pointed to by different links.
  $FILE1 -ef $FILE2
  ```

- Unary operators that check file characteristics.

  |    `-x`    |                     File is executable                      |

#### 1.2.7.4. Testing for More than One Thing

- Use the logical AND (`-a`) and OR (`-o`) to combine more than one test in an expression.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The following will test to see if a file is both readable and writeable.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  if [ -r $FILE -a -w $FILE ]
  ```

- You can make several `AND`/`OR` conjunctions in one statement. You might need to use parentheses to get the proper
  precedence, as in `a and (b or c)`, but if you use parentheses, be sure to escape their special meaning from the
  shell by putting a backslash before each or by quoting each parenthesis. Don't try to quote the entire expression in
  one set of quotes, however, as that will make your entire expression a single term that will be treated as a test for
  an empty string.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The following is an example of a more complex test with the parentheses properly escaped.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  if [ -r "$FN" -a \( -f "$FN" -o -p "$FN" \) ]
  ```

- Don't count on short circuits in your conditionals. If you need that kind of behaviour, just break the `if`
  statement into two nested `if` statements, or use `&&` and `||`
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.7.5. Testing for String Characteristics

- There are some simple tests that you can do with the builtin `test` command, using the single-bracket `if`
  statements.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # cookbook filename: checkstr

  VAR="$1"

  # if [ "$VAR" ] will usually work but is bad form, using -n is more clear
  if [ -n "$VAR" ]
  then
    echo has text
  else
    echo zero length
  fi

  if [ -z "$VAR" ]
  then
    echo zero length
  else
    echo has text
  fi
  ```

- The use of the phrase "has any length" is deliberate. There are two types of variables that will have no length -
  those that have been set to an empty string and those that have note been set at all. This does not distinguish
  between those two cases. All it asks if whether or not there are some characters in the variable.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- It is important to put quotes around an expression when checking a string, to avoid any unexpected substitution.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.7.6. Testing for Equality

- Use the `-eq` operator for numeric comparisons and the equality primary `=` (or `==`) for string comparisons.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # cookbook filename: strvsnum

  VAR1=" 05 "
  VAR2="5"

  printf "%s" "do they -eq as equal? "
  if [ "$VAR1" -eq "$VAR2" ]
  then
    echo YES
  else
    echo NO
  fi

  printf "%s" "do they = as equal? "
  if [ "$VAR1" = "$VAR2" ]
  then
    echo YES
  else
    echo NO
  fi
  ```

- The following is the output from running the script int he previous example.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ bash strvsnum
  do they -eq as equal? YES
  do they = as equal? NO
  $
  ```

- Both `=` and `==` are accepted, but `=` follows the POSIX standard and is more portable.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- One way to remember which to use  is that it feels "counter-intuitive": the string-like comparisons (the syntax using
  character, e.g., `-eq`) are for numbers and the numeric-looking comparators (e.g., `+<=+`) are for strings.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  | **Numeric** | **String** |       **Meaning**        |
  | :---------: | :--------: | :----------------------: |
  |    `-lt`    |    `<`     |        Less than         |
  |    `-le`    |    `<=`    |  Less than or equal to   |
  |    `-gt`    |    `>`     |       Greater than       |
  |    `-ge`    |    `>=`    | Greater than or equal to |
  |    `-eq`    |    `=`     |         Equal to         |
  |    `-eq`    |   `= =`    |         Equal to         |
  |    `-ne`    |    `!=`    |       Not equal to       |

- The best solution is to always do your numerical tests with the double parentheses syntax and your string comparison
  with the double-square-brackets syntax. Then you can always use the math-style symbols for comparison.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

### 1.2.8. Testing with Pattern Matches

- You can use a single of double equals sign, as in the following example.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  if [[ "${MY_FILENAME}" == *.jpg ]]
  ```

- The standard pattern matching includes the `*` to match any number of characters, the `?` to match a single
  characters, and `[]` for including a list of possible characters. These resemble shell file wildcards, and are not
  regular expressions.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Don't put quotes around the pattern if you want it to behave as a pattern, otherwise it will treat the pattern as a
  literal string.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- There are more powerful pattern-matching capabilities available by turning on some additional options in `bash`. The
  `shopt -s` command is the way to turn on shell options. The `extglob` option deals with extended pattern matching (or
  globbing). The first character preceding the parentheses says whether the list should match just once occurrence of a
  pattern in the list (using a leading `@` or some other criteria.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  shopt -s extglob
  if [[ "$FN" == *.@(jpg|jpeg) ]]
  then
  ```

- Grouping symbols for extended pattern matching.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  | **Grouping** |         **Meaning**         |
  | :----------: | :-------------------------: |
  |   `@(...)`   |     Only one occurrence     |
  |   `*(...)`   |  Zero or more occurrences   |
  |   `+(...)`   |   One or more occurrences   |
  |   `?(...)`   |   Zero or one occurrence    |
  |   `!(...)`   | Not this, but anything else |

- Matches are case-sensitive, but you may use `shopt -s nocasematch` to change that. This option affects `case` and
  `[[` commands.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.8.1. Testing with Regular Expressions

- The `=~` operator requires `bash` version 3.0 or newer - older versions don't have the operator.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.8.2. Looping for a While

- Use the `while` looping construct for arithmetic conditions. The double parentheses delimit an arithmetic expression,
  very much like the `$(())` expression for shell variable assignment. The variable names inside the parentheses are
  meant to be dereferenced, meaning you don't write `$VAR`, and instead use `VAR` inside the parentheses. Any
  expression in the parentheses is evaluated, and if the result if non-zero, then the result of the `(())` is to return
  a `0` (`true`); similarly a zero result returns a `1` (`false`).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  while (( COUNT < MAX ))
  do
    some stuff
    let COUNT++
  done
  ```

- Use the `while` loop for file system-related conditions. The use of a single square bracket is the same as using the
  `test` statement.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  while [ -z "$LOCKFILE" ]
  do
    some things
  done
  ```

- Use the `while` loop for reading input. The syntax of this `while` statements in `bash` is defined such that the
  condition of the `while` statements is a list of statements to be executed, and the exit status of the last statement
  determines whether the condition is `true` (an exit status of `0`) or `false` (an exit status other than `0`).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  while read line_of_text
  do
    process $line_of_text
  done
  ```

#### 1.2.8.3. Looping with a `read`

- A common use of a `while` loop is to read files and the output of previous commands.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Both the scripts in this section remove files that are reported with a question mark.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- One example of a script to read the file. This example uses several subprograms to do its work and would fit on a
  single line in a typical terminal window.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  svn status mysrc | grep '^?' | cut -c8- |
    while read FN; do echo "$FN"; rm -rf "$FN"; done
  ```

- Another example of a script to read the file. This example is more shell-like, since it doesn't need `grep` to do its
  searching (it uses the `if` statement) and it doesn't need `cut` to do its parsing (it uses the `read` statement).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  svn status mysrc |
  while read TAG FN
  do
    if [[ $TAG == \? ]]
    then
      echo $FN
      rm -rf "$FN"
    fi
  done
  ```

#### 1.2.8.4. Looping with a Count

- Use the `for` syntax when you need to loop a fixed number of times. The syntax is quite similar to C's, but with
  double parentheses.

  ```bash
  for (( i=0 ; i < 10 ; i++ )) ; do echo $i ; done
  ```

- In early versions of `bash`, the original syntax for the `for` loop only included iterating over a fixed list of
  items.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The variation of the `for` loop with the C-like syntax has been in `bash` since version 2.04, with the format.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  for (( expression_1 ; expression_2 ; expression_3 )) ; do action ; done
  ```

- The use of double parentheses is meant to indicate these are arithmetic expressions. You don't need to use the `$`
  construct when referring to variables inside the double parentheses. The expressions are integer arithmetic.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.8.5. Looping with Floating-Point Values

- The `seq` command is used to generate floating-point values in a `for` loop, as `for` loops with arithmetic
  expressions only does integer arithmetic.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The `seq` command will generate a sequence of floating-point numbers, one per line. The arguments to `seq` are the
  starting value, the increment, and the ending value.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  sed starting_value increment ending_value
  ```

- In this example, the `$()` runs the command in a subshell and returns the result with the new lines replaced by just
  whitespace, so each value is a string value for the `for` loop.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  for fp in $(seq 1.0 .01 1.1)
  do
    echo $fp; other stuff too
  done
  ```

- In this example, `seq` is run as a command with its output piped into a `while` loop that reads each line and
  performs an operation on the line. This would be the preferred approach for a long sequence, as it can run the `seq`
  command in parallel with the `while`. The `for` loop example must run `seq` to completion and produce its output on
  the command line for the `for` statement.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.8.6. Branching Many Ways

- Use the `case` statement for a multi-way branch. The `case` statement will expand the word (including parameter
  substitution) between the `case` and `in` keywords. It will then try to match the word with the patterns listed in
  order.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  case $FN in
    *.gif) gif2png $FN
      ;;
    *.png) pngOK $FN
      ;;
    *.jpg) jpg2gif $FN
      ;;
    *.tif | *.TIFF) tif2jpg $FN
      ;;
    *) printf "File not supported: %s" $FN
      ;;
  esac
  ```

- The case statement in the previous example is equivalent to the following `if`/`then`/`else` statement:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  if [[ $FN == *.gif ]]
  then
    gif2png $FN
    elif [[ $FN == *.png ]]
  then
    pngOK $FN
    elif [[ $FN == *.jpg ]]
  then
    jpg2gif $FN
    elif [[ $FN == *.tif || $FN == *.TIFF ]]
  then
    tif2jpg $FN
  else
    printf "File not supported: %s" $FN
  fi
  ```

- Use `|` meaning logical `OR` to separate different patterns for which you want to take the same action.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- There is no `else` or `default` keyword to indicate the statements that execute if no pattern matches. Use `*` as the
  last pattern, since that pattern will match anything. Placing it last makes it act as the default and match anything
  that hasn't already been matched.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The `;;` ends the set of statements associated with a pattern. The `;;&` construct means that even if a match is
  found, the next pattern will be tested for a match and its statements will be executed as well if another match is
  found. The `;&` construct means that execution will "fall through" and the next set of statements will be executed
  regardless of whether its pattern matches.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  case $FN in
    *.gif) gif2png $FN
      ;;& # keep looking
    *.png) pngOK $FN
      ;;& # keep looking
    *.jpg) jpg2gif $FN
      ;;& # keep looking
    *.tif) tif2jpg $FN
      ;& # fall through
    *.* ) echo "two.words"
      ;;
    * ) echo "oneword"
  esac
  ```

- Matches are case-sensitive, but you can use `shopt -s nocasematch` to make the `case` statement ignore case.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.8.7. Parsing Command-Line Arguments

- When using `printf` for error message, using single quotes around the string if you don't want the shell to try to
  interpret any of the string. End the line with `>$2` to tell the shell to redirect the output to standard error.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Use the `shift` keyword at the end of a `while` loop so as to consume the parameter, otherwise the `while` would
  execute indefinitely. The `shift` causes the second argument (`$2`) to become the first (`$1`) and so on to all
  arguments. The use of `shift` also causes `$#` to become one argument smaller. This is important if `$#` is used to
  determine the amount of times to execute a `while` loop.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.8.8. Creating Simple Menus

- You can write a shell script to choose from a list of names to create simple character-based screen menus. In the
  following example, the `select` statement displays a list of words, each preceded by a number. The user will then be
  prompted for input. The user makes a choice by typing the number and the corresponding words is assigned to the
  specified after the `select` keyword.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # cookbook filename: dbinit.1
  DB_LIST=$(sh ./listdb | tail -n +2)
  select DB in $DB_LIST
  do
    echo Initialising database: $DB
    mysql -u user -p $DB <myinit.sql
  done
  ```

- The following is an example output of running the script.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ ./dbinit
  1) testDB
  2) simpleInventory
  3) masterInventory
  4) otherDB
  #? 2
  Initialising database: simpleInventory
  #?

  $
  ```

- The `select` statement is essentially a loop. When the user enters a choice, the body of the loop (between the `do`
  and `done` will be executed), and then the script will re-prompt for the next value. It doesn't re-display the list
  each time, only if the user makes no choice and simply presses the `<Enter>` key. The looping will stop when it
  reaches the end of the file, which means when the user types `<Ctrl> + d`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.8.9. Changing the Prompt on Simple Menus

- The `bash` environment variable `$PS3` is the prompt used by `select`. If you don't like the prompt in the `select`
  menu, set the `$PS3` environment variable to a new value and you'll get a new prompt.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  !/usr/bin/env bash
  # cookbook filename: dbinit.2
  DB_LIST=$(sh ./listdb | tail --lines="+2")
  PS3="0 inits >"
  select DB in $DB_LIST
  do
    if [ $DB ]
    then
      echo Initialising database: $DB

      PS3="$((++i)) inits> "

      mysql -u user -p $DB <myinit.sql
    fi
  done
  ```

- `$PS3` is the third of the `bash` prompts.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `$PS1` is the prompt you get before most commands. `$` is used in most of this book's examples, but it can be much
    more elaborate than that, including the user ID or directory name.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `$PS2` is used if a line of command needs to be continued.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `$PS3` is used for `select` prompts. Set it before the `select` statement for you to change the prompt. You can
    even modify `$PS3` as the loop progresses.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

### 1.2.9. Intermediate Shell Tools I

- One of the overarching philosophies of Unix (and therefore Linux) is that of small program pieces that can be
  combined to produce powerful results. These program pieces are limited in scope. Instead of a single program to
  process everything, we have many different programs that do one thing well. This extends to `bash`, where there are
  times when it is easier to use other commands to accomplish a task even if `bash` syntax could perform that
  operation.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.9.1. Sifting Through Files for a String

- The `grep` command searches through files looking for the expression you supply as an argument.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.9.2. Getting Just the Filename from a Search

- Use the `--files-with-matches` (or `-l` for short)  option of `grep` to get just the file names.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.9.3. Getting a Simple True/False from a Search

- Use the `quiet` option for `grep` when you want to know whether a certain string is in a particular file, and you
  just want a yes or no answer. You can then use the output of the `grep` command to determine whether to print `yes`
  or `no`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ if grep --quiet find_me big_data.file ; then echo yes ; else echo nope ; fi
  nope

  $
  ```

- If multiple file names are listed after `grep --quiet`, then `grep` stops searching after the very first occurrence
  of the search string being found. This means `grep` only wants to know whether it found any occurrence of the string.
  If you really need to read through all the files, redirect the output of `grep` to `/dev/null` instead of using the
  `--quiet` keyword.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ if grep find_me big_data.file > /dev/null ; then echo yes ; else echo nope ; fi
  nope

  $
  ```

- The `/dev/null` technique is also useful if you want to write shell scripts that are portable across the various
  flavours of `grep` available on Unix and Linux systems, if one does not support the `--quiet` option.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.9.4. Doing a Search in a Pipeline

- When no file name is supplied to `grep`, it reads from standard input.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  some pipeline | of commands | grep
  ```

- If you want `grep` to search through error messages from a previous command, be sure to redirect its error into
  standard output before the pipe.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  gcc big_bad_code.c 2>&1 | grep -i error
  ```

#### 1.2.9.5. Grepping Compressed Files

- Use `zgrep`, `zcat`, `gzcat` when you need to `grep` some compressed files.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `zgrep` is simply a `grep` that understands various compressed and uncompressed file types (the types vary from
  system to system).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `zcat` is simply a `cat` that understands various compressed and uncompressed file types (the types vary between
  systems). It is more likely to understand more formats than `zgrep`, and may be installed on more systems by default.
  It can also be used in recovering damaged compressed files, since it will output everything it possibly can, instead
  of error out as `gunzip` or other tools.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `gzcat` is similar to `zcat`, but the differences are based on the commercial vs free Unix variants, and backwards
  compatibility.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The `less` utility can also be configured to transparently display various compressed files.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.9.6. Keeping Some Output, Discarding the Rest

- Use the `awk` utility to retain some of our output and discard the rest.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The `awk` program can be used in several different ways. Its easiest, simplest use is just to print one or more
  selected fields from its input.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Fields are delineated by whitespace (or specified with the `-F` option) and are numbered starting at 1. The field
  `$0` represents the entire line of input.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.9.7. Keeping Only a Portion of a Line of Output

- If you want to keep only a portion of a line of output, such as just the first and last words, e.g., listing the file
  names and permissions from an `ls -l` output, without all the other information.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Pipe `ls` into `awk`, and just extract the required fields. The various fields in `awk` are referenced using a dollar
  sign, followed by a field number (e.g., `$1`, `$2`, `$3`). `awk` has a variable called `NF` that holds the number of
  found on the current line, `$NF` always refers to the last field.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ ls -l | awk '{print $1, $NF}'
  total 151130
  -rw-r--r-- add.1
  drwxr-xr-x art
  drwxr-xr-x bin
  -rw-r--r-- BuddyIcon.png
  drwxr-xr-x CDs
  drwxr-xr-x downloads
  drwxr-sr-x eclipse
  ...

  $
  ```

- You don't use a `$` to read the value of an `awk` variable (unlike `bash` variables). `NF` is a valid variable
  reference by itself. Adding a `$` before it changes its meaning from "the number of fields on the current line" to
  "the last field on the current line."
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.9.8. Reversing the Words on Each Line

- Enclosing an `awk` program in single quotes allows the `bash` shell to allow multiple lines. Both `awk` commands in
  the following code block are equivalent.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ awk '{
  >   for (i=NF; i>=0; i--) {
  >     printf "%s ", $i;
  >   }
  >   printf "\n"
  > }' <filename>
  $
  $ awk '{for (i=NF; i>=0; i--) {printf "%s ", $i;} printf "\n" }'<filename>
  ```

- The `awk` language has syntax for a `for` loop. It even supports a `printf` mechanism for formatted output. The `for`
  loop in the previous code block counts down from the last to the first field, and prints each field.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The reference to `$i` is very different in `awk` compared to `bash` `$i` in `bash` means we are referencing the value
  stored in the variable named `i`. In `awk`, as with most programming languages, we simply reference the value in `i`
  by naming it - that is, by just writing `i`. When `$i` is used in `awk`, the value of the variable `i` is resolved to
  a number - the `i`th field.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.9.9. Summing a List of Numbers

- Use `awk` both to isolate the fields to be summed and to do the summing. The following example sums up the numbers
  that are the file sizes from the output of an `ls -l` command. We enclose the two bodies of our `awk` program in
  braces (`{}`).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  ls -l | awk '{sum += $5}; END {print sum}'
  ```

- There can be more than one body (or block) of code in an `awk` program.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- A block of code preceded by the literal keyword `END` is only run once, when the rest of the program has finished.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You can prefix a block of code with `BEGIN` and supply some code that will be run before an input is read. The
  `BEGIN` block is useful for initialising variables. It could have been used to initialise `sum`, but `awk` guarantees
  that variables will start empty.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If there is a starting line that you would like to exclude from the `awk` command, then you can use either of the
  examples in the following code block. The first example eliminates the line you would wish to exclude. The `^total`
  in the second example is a regular expression; it means "the letters containing `t`-`o`-`t`-`a`-`l` occurring at the
  beginning of a line. For any line of input matching that regex, the associated block of code will be executed. The
  `next` command is added to end processing on the line starting with `total` and starts processing on the next line of
  input. An alternative to the `next` would be `getline`, but `getline` does not rematch all the patterns from the top,
  only ones from there on down.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ ls -l | grep --invert-match '^total' | awk '{sum += $5}; END {print sum}'

  $

  $ ls -l | awk '/^total/{next} {sum += $5}; END {print sum}'

  $
  ```

- In `awk` programming, the order of the blocks of code matters.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.9.10. Counting String Values with `awk`

- Use `awk`'s associative arrays (also known as "hashes" or "dictionaries" in other languages) if you need to count all
  the occurrences of several different strings, including some strings whose values you don't know beforehand.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The following example will count how many files are owned by various users on a system. The username shows up as the
  third field in the `ls -l` output.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/awk -f
  # cookbook filename: associative_arrays.awk
  # Associative arrays in Awk
  # Usage: ls -lR /usr/local | associative_arrays.awk
  NF > 7 {
    user[$3]++
  }
  END {
    for (i in user) {
      printf "%s owns %d files\n", i, user[i]
    }
  }
  ```

- The following is the output of executing the `awk` command in the previous example, in a file named
  `associative_arrays.awk`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ ls -lR /usr/local | awk -f associative_arrays.awk
  bin owns 68 files
  root owns 13755 files
  man owns 11491 files

  $
  ```

- The `NF > 7` is used as a qualifier to part of the `awk` script to weed out the lines that do not contain file names,
  as such lines do not has as many fields (or words). Only if a line has more than 7 fields (words of text) will it be
  processed by the statements within the braces. The username is used as the index to the array, incremented by
  `user[$3]++`. The array is called an "associative array" because a hash table (or similar mechanism) is being used to
  associate each string with a numerical value.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.9.11. Counting String Values with `bash`

- Like in the previous section, use `bash`'s associative arrays (also known as "hashes" or "dictionaries" in other
  languages) if you need to count all the occurrences of several different strings, including some strings whose values
  you don't know beforehand. `bash` 4.0 introduced the functionality for associative arrays for your counting.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The following example uses `read -a LSL` read a line at a time, and each word (delineated by whitespace) is assigned
  to an entry in the array `LSL`. The size of the array is then checked to determine how many reads were read and to
  then filter out the lines that do not contain file names. Such lines are part of the `ls -l --recursive` output and
  are usually useful for readability as they include blank lines to separate different directories, as well as total
  counts for each subdirectory. Only for lines with at least 7 words do we take the third word, which should be the
  file's owner, and use that as an index to our associative array. With standard arrays (such as `LSL`), each element
  is referred to by its index and that index is an integer. With associative arrays, the index can be a string.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # # cookbook filename: cnt_owner
  # count owners of a file using bash
  # pipe "ls -l" into this script
  declare -A ACCOUNT
  while read -a LSL
  do
    # only consider lines that are 7 words or longer
    if (( ${#LSL[*]} > 7 )) # the size of the array
    then
      NDX=${LSL[3]} # string assign
      (( ACCOUNT[${NDX}] += 1 )) # math increment
    fi
  done
  for VALS in "${!ACCOUNT[@]}" # index of each element
  do
    echo $VALS "owns" ${ACCOUNT[$VALS]} "files"
  done
  ```

- The following is the output of executing the `bash` script seen in the previous example. The following output is in
  no particular order, if you wish to sort it by name or the number of files, then pipe the following result into the
  `sort` command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ ls -lR /usr/local | bash cnt_owner.sh
  bin owns 68 files
  root owns 13755 files
  man owns 11491 files

  $
  ```

#### 1.2.9.12. Showing Data as a Quick and Easy Histogram

- You can use the associative arrays of `awk` to compute and draw a histogram. The string format `%-10.10s` will
  left-justify and pad to 10 characters but also truncate at 10 characters. The integer format `%8d` will ensure the
  integer is printed in an 8-character field. This gives each histogram the same starting point, by using the same
  amount of space regardless of the username or the size of the integer. The data returned from the `for` loop is in no
  particular order. If you wanted the histogram displayed in sorted order, either numeric by count of alphabetical by
  username, you would have to add some sorting, by sending the output from the first part of the script into the `sort`
  command and then piping that output into the second piece to print the histogram.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/awk -f
  # cookbook filename: hist.awk
  # Histograms in Awk
  # Usage: ls -lR /usr/local | hist.awk
  function max(arr, big)
  {
    big = 0;

    for (i in user)
    {
      if (user[i] > big)
      {
        big=user[i];
      }
    }
    return big
  }

  NF > 7 {
    user[$3]++
  }

  END {
    # for scaling
    maxm = max(user);

    for (i in user) {
      #printf "%s owns %d files\n", i, user[i]
      scaled = 60 * user[i] / maxm ;
      printf "%-10.10s [%8d]:", i, user[i]

      for (i=0; i<scaled; i++) {
        printf "#";
      }

      printf "\n";
    }
  }
  ```

- The following is the output of running the script in the previous example.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ ls -lR /usr/local | awk -f hist.awk
  bin [ 68]:#
  root [ 13755]:##################################################
  man [ 11491]:##########################################

  $
  ```

#### 1.2.9.13. An Easy Histogram with `bash`

- You can use the associative arrays native to `bash` (in all versions from 4.0 onward) to compute and draw your
  histogram.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- First, we make a pass over the values to find the largest value, so we can scale our output to fit on the page.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  BIG=0
  for VALS in "${!UCOUNT[@]}"
  do
    if (( UCOUNT[$VALS] > BIG )) ; then BIG=${UCOUNT[$VALS]} ; fi
  done
  ```

- With a maximum value (in `BIG`), we output a line for each entry in the array. The construct `"${!UCOUNT@]"` is
  crucial. It evaluates to a list of index values used on the array. The `for` loop takes each value and uses it as the
  index into the array to get the count for that user. The array is scaled to `59` pieces, and then add `1`, so that
  any non-zero value will have at least one mark on the histogram. This isn't a problem on the `awk` version in the
  previous section (as `awk` uses floating-point maths), but the `bash` version uses integer maths, so anything too
  small may end up as `0` after the division.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # print the histogram
  for VALS in "${!UCOUNT[@]}"
  do
    printf "%-9.9s [%7d]:" $VALS ${UCOUNT[$VALS]}

    # scale to the max value (BIG); N.B. integer /
    SCALED=$(( ( (59 * UCOUNT[$VALS]) / BIG) +1 ))

    for ((i=0; i<SCALED; i++)) {
      printf "#"
    }

    printf "\n"
  done
  ```

#### 1.2.9.14. Showing a Paragraph of Text After a Found Phrase

- Assuming a simple text file, where *paragraph* means all the text between blank lines, so the occurrence of a blank
  line implies a paragraph break. The following example is an `awk` program that can be used for when you are
  searching for a phrase in a document, and want to show the paragraph after the found phrase.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ cat para.awk
  /keyphrase/ { flag=1 }
  flag == 1 { print }
  /^$/ { flag=0 }
  $ awk -f para.awk < search_this.txt
  ```

  - The first code block is invoked when a line of output matches the regular expression. If the regular expression
    occurs within a line of input, that is a match and this block of code will be executed. The flag is set.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The second code block is invoked for every line of input, since there is no regular expression preceding its open
    brace. This block prints the entire input line, but only if the flag is set. Even the input that matches the
    regular expression will be applied to this code block.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The third block has a regular expression that - if satisfied - will reset the flag by turning it off. That regular
    expression uses two characters with special meaning: the `^` for matching the beginning of the line and the `$` for
    matching the end of the line. Thus, the regular expression `^$` matches an empty line, with no characters between
    the beginning and end of the line.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

### 1.2.10. Intermediate Shell Tools II

- This chapter introduces some more useful utilities that are not part of the *bash* shell, but are used in many shell
  scripts.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Theses utilities are written not just as standalone commands, also as *filters* that can be included in a pipeline of
  commands.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.10.1. Sorting Your Output

- Use the `sort` utility when you would like output in a sorted order.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You can sort one or more files by putting the file name on the command line.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  sort file1.txt file2.txt my_other_file.xyz
  ```

- With no file names on the command line, `sort` will read from standard input, so you can pipe the output from a
  previous command into `sort`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  some_commands | sort
  ```

#### 1.2.10.2. Sorting Numbers

- When sorting numeric data, you will see the order doesn't seem right.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ sort some_data
  2
  200
  21
  250

  $
  ```

- You will need to specify a numeric sort with the `--numeric-sort` option when sorting data that should be sorted as
  numbers.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ sort -n some_data
  2
  21
  200
  250

  $
  ```

- The first example (and the default behaviour in `sort`) is an alphabetic sort on data (i.e., 21 comes after 200, as
  1 comes after 0 in an alphabetic sort).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.10.3. Sorting IP Addresses

- Sorting IP addresses by the last octet only (the old syntax), via the last portion of the number.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ sort --field-separator="." --numeric-sort +3.0 ipaddr.list
  10.0.0.2
  192.168.0.2
  192.168.0.4
  10.0.0.5
  192.168.0.12
  10.0.0.20

  $
  ```

- Sorting IP addresses by the entire address (the POSIX syntax).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ sort --field-separator="." --key"1,1n" --key="2,2n" --key="3,3n" --k="4,4n" ipaddr.list
  10.0.0.2
  10.0.0.5
  10.0.0.20
  192.168.0.2
  192.168.0.4
  192.168.0.12

  $
  ```

- The `--field-separator` operator indicates the character to use as a separator between fields (`.` in both of the
  previous examples), so we can specify which fields to sort first.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - In the first example, sorting starts with the third field from the left (the last field in our example, as the
    field numbering is zero-based), and then the very first  character in that third field, (character numbering is
    also zero-based), hence the `+3.0`.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - In the second example, the new POSIX specification was used instead of the traditional (but obsolete) `+pos1`
    `-pos2` method. Unlike the older method, it is not zero-based, so fields start at 1. In this case, `--key="1,1n"`
    means "start sorting at the beginning of field one (`1`) and (`,`) stop sorting at the end of field one (`1`), and
    do a numerical sort (`n`). When using more than one field, it's very important to tell `sort` where to stop. The
    default is to go to the end of the line.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The order that `sort` uses is affected by your locale setting. If your results are not as expected, that's one
  location to check.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.10.4. Cutting Out Parts of Your Output

- Use the `cut` command with the `--commands` to take particular columns when you are reading fixed-width or
  column-based data, and you'd like to take a subset of it, based on the column position.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ ps -l | cut --characters="12-15"
  PID
  5391
  7285
  7286

  $
  ```

- The `cut` command specifies the portion we would like to keep out of each line.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Most of the data manipulation looked at so far has been based on *fields*, with positions separated by characters
  called *delimiters*. The `cut` command can do the same, but it is one of the few utilities in `bash` that can easily
  deal with fixed-width, columnar data (via the `--characters` option).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.10.5. Removing Duplicate Lines

- You can get rid of the duplicates from an output, so you can see just the unique values.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If you've just been sorting your output, add the `--unique` option to the sort command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  some_sequence | sort --unique
  ```

- If you aren't running `sort`, pipe the output into `uniq`, assuming the output is already sorted so that identical
  lines are adjacent.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Don't accidentally overwrite a valuable file by mistake. While most Unix/Linux commands take multiple input files on
  the command line, `uniq` does not. The first (mandatory) argument is the input file and the second argument
  (optional) is the output file. If you supply two file names on the command line, the second one will get clobbered
  without warning.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.10.6. Compressing Files

- In traditional Unix, archiving and compressing files are two different operations performed with two different tools,
  while in DOS and Windows it's typically one operation with one tool.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- A "tarball" is created by combining several files and/or directories using the `tar` (tape archive) command, then
  compressed using the `compress`, `gzip`, or `bzip2` tools. This results in files such as `tarball.tar.Z`,
  `tarball.tar.gz`, `tarball.tgz`, or `tarball.tar.bz2`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- In order to use the correct format, you need to understand where your data will be used. If you are compressing some
  files for yourself, use whatever you find easiest. If other people will need to use your data, consider what platform
  they will be using and what they are comfortable with.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- When using `tar`, it is strongly recommended to use a relative directory to store all the files. If you use an
  absolute directory, you may inadvertently overwrite something on a system. If you don't use any directory, you'll
  clutter whatever directory the user is in when they extract the files.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.10.7. Uncompressing Files

- You must determine the type of archive to use before extracting a file. Different archive file types use different
  tools to extract their contents.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  | **File Extension** |                  **Command**                   |
  | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------: |
  |       `.tar`       |  `tar tf` (list contents), `tar xf` (extract)  |
  | `.tar.tgz`, `.tgz` | `tar tzf` (list contents), `tar xzf` (extract) |
  |     `tar.bz2`      | `tar tjf` (list contents), `tar xjf` (extract) |
  |      `tar.Z`       | `tar tZf` (list contents), `tar xZf` (extract) |
  |       `.zip`       |                    `unzip`                     |

- The `file` command is helpful as it can tell you the type of a file even if the name is incorrect.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ file what_is_this.*
  what_is_this.1: GNU tar archive
  what_is_this.2: gzip compressed data, from Unix
  ```

#### 1.2.10.8. Checking a `tar` Archive for Unique Directories

- Use an `awk` script to parse off the directory name from the `tar` archive's table of contents, then use
  `sort --unique` to output just the directory names when you want to untar an archive, but you want to know
  beforehand which directories it is going to write into.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  tar tf some.tar | awk -F/ '{print $1}' | sort --unique
  ```

- The `t` option in the `tar` command will produce the table of contents for the file specified with the file name,
  `f`. The `awk` command specifies a non-default field separator by using `-F/` to specify a slash as the separator
  between fields. Thus, the `print $1` will print the first directory name in the path name.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.10.9. Translating Characters

- Use the `tr` command to translate one character to another when you need to convert one character to another in all
  of your text.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- In the following example, input is redirected from the file `be.fore` and sent to the file `at.ter`, after
  translating all occurrences of a semicolon into a comma.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  tr ';' ',' <be.fore >af.ter
  ```

- The `tr` command can do more than one translation at a time if we put the several characters to be translated in the
  first argument and their corresponding resultant character(s) in the second argument.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The following example will translate all occurrences of the punctuation symbols of semicolon, colon, period,
  exclamation point, and question mark to commas.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  tr ';:.!?' ',' <other.punct >commas.all
  ```

- This kind of translation could be done with the `sed` command, though the `sed` syntax is tricker. The `tr` command
  is not as powerful, since it doesn't use regular expressions, but it does have special syntax for ranges of
  characters that can be useful.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.10.10. Converting Upper-case to Lower-case

- You can translate all upper-case characters (*A-Z*) to lower-case (*a-z*) using the `tr` command and specifying and
  range of characters.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' <be.fore >af.ter
  ```

- There is also a special syntax in `tr` for specifying this sort of range for upper- and lower-case conversions.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' <be.fore >af.ter
  ```

- There are some versions of `tr` that honour the current locale's collating sequence, and *A-Z* may not always be set
  of upper-case letters in the current locale. It's better to avoid that problem and use `[:lower:]` and `[:upper:]` if
  possible, but that makes it difficult to use sub-ranges like *N-Z* and *a-m*.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `tr` doesn't support regular expressions, but it does support a range of characters. Just make sure that both
  arguments have the same number of characters. If the second argument is shorted, its last character will be repeated
  to match the length of the first argument. If the first argument is shorter, the second argument will be truncated
  to match the length of the first.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.10.11. Converting DOS Files to Linux Format

- In DOS, each line ends with a pair of characters - the return and the new line. In Linux, each line ends with a single
  new line.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Use the `-d` option on `tr` to delete the character(s) in the supplied list. The following example deletes all DOS
  carriage returns (`\r`) in the file, not just those at the end of the line. It is possible that typical text files
  will have characters like that inline.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  tr --delete '\r' <file.dos >file.txt
  ```

- An alternative to using the `tr` command to convert a DOS file to a Unix file and vice versa is via the `dos2unix`
  and `unix2dos` commands, respectively.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.10.12. Removing Smart Quotes

- If you copy ASCII text out of a document written in Microsoft Word and see some odd characters when you save the
  text, you can translate the odd characters back to simple ASCII like in the following example.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The *221* and *222* (octal) curved single quotes will be translated to simple single quotes. We specify them in
    octal (*027*) to make the process easier, since the shell uses single quotes as a delimiter.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The *223* and *224* (octal) are opening and closing curved double quotes, and will be translated to simple double
    quotes. The double quotes can by typed within the second argument since the single quotes protect us from shell
    interpretation.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The *226* and *227* (octal) are dash characters and will be translated into hyphens.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  tr '\221\222\223\224\226\227' '\047\047""--' <odd.txt >plain.txt
  ```

#### 1.2.10.13. Counting Lines, Words, or Characters in a File

- Use the `wc` (word count) command to determine how many lines, words, or characters are in a given file.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.10.14. Rewrapping Paragraphs

- Use the `fmt` command to rewrap lines of text that are too long or too short.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- One intricacy about `fmt` is that it expects blank lines to separate headers and paragraphs. If your input file
  doesn't have those blanks, it has no means to differentiate different paragraphs and extra new lines inside the same
  paragraph - so you will be outputted one giant paragraph, with the correct lengths.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.10.15. Doing More with `less`

- `less` takes options from the `$LESS` variable, so instead of creating an alias with your favourite options, assign
  them to that variable. It takes both long and short options, and any command-line options will override options in
  variable.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  export LESS="--LONG-PROMPT --LINE-NUMBERS --ignore-case --QUIET"
  ```

- `less` is expandable via *input preprocessors*; programs or scripts that pre-process the file that `less` is about to
  display. This is handled by setting the `$LESSOPEN` and `$LESSCLOSE` environment variables appropriately.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

### 1.2.11. Finding Files: `find`, `locate`, `slocate`

- `bash` provides some very powerful search capabilities that enable you to search by file name, dates of
  creation/modification, even content.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.11.1. Finding All Your MP3 Files

- The `find` utility can locate all the file you are searching for and then execute a command to move them where you
  want.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  find . -name '*.mp3' -print -exec mv '{}' ~/songs \;
  ```

- The syntax for the `find` utility is unlike that of any other Unix tools. It doesn't use options seen in other tools,
  with dash and single-letter collections up front, followed by several words of arguments. Rather, the options look
  short words, and are ordered in a logical sequence describing the logic of which files are to be found, and what to
  to with them (if anything) when they are found. These word-like options are called *predicates*.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The following is the structure of running the previous command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The `find` command's first argument(s) is/are the directory/directories in which to search. You can provide a list
    of directories.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The `-name` predicate specifies the pattern to search for. Its syntax is like the `bash` pattern-matching syntax
    Any file that matches this pattern is considered to return true, and is passed to the next predicate in the
    command. Encounter a false, and that file name's turn is immediately over, and the next file name is processed.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The `-print` predicate has the side effect of printing the name to standard output, so any file that has made it
    this far in the sequence will have its name printed to standard output.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The `-exec` predicate will execute a command on any file name making it this far. The remainder of the line - up to
    the `\;` - is the command to be executed. The `{}` is replaced by the name of the file that was found. The command
    will be issued for each file that matches the pattern.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  find <directory_name(s)> -name <file_pattern> -print -exec <command to execute>
  ```

#### 1.2.11.2. Handling Filenames Containing Odd Characters

- In Unix, "odd" means anything "not a lower-case letter, or maybe a number." Thus, upper-case letters, spaces,
  punctuation, and character accents are all odd.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Depending on the oddness of the character and your system, tools, and goal, it might be enough to simple quote the
  replacement string.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If quoting a string does not work, then using the `-print0` argument to the `find` command and the `-0` argument to
  `xargs`. `-print0` tells `find` to use the null character (`\0`) instead of white-space as the output delimiter
  between pathnames found. `-0` tells `xargs` the input delimiter. These are no supported on every system.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The `xargs` command takes white-space-delimited (except when using `-0` path names from standard input and executes a
  specified command on as many of them as possible. Since there is a lot of overhead associated with calling other
  commands, using `xargs` can drastically speed up operations because you are calling the other command as few times as
  possible, rather than each time a path name is found.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Rewriting the example from [1.2.11.1. Finding All Your MP3 Files](#12111-finding-all-your-mp3-files).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  find . -name '*.mp3' -print0 | xargs -i -0 mv '{}' ~/songs
  ```

#### 1.2.11.3. Finding Files Across Symbolic Links

- Use the `-follow` predicate when you wish to find files that are mounted via symbolic link. The default for `find` is
  to not follow a symbolic links. If you want to do so, then use the `-L` option on your `find` command, immediately
  following the command name and before the directory list.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  find -L . -name '*.mp3' -print0 | xargs -i -0 mv '{}' ~/songs
  ```

#### 1.2.11.4. Finding Files Irrespective of Case

- Use the `-iname` predicate to run a case-insensitive search, rather than just `-name`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  find . -follow -iname '*.mp3' -print0 | xargs -i -0 mv '{}' ~/songs
  ```

- Not every version of `find` supports the `-iname` predicate, so you can use regular expressions instead, or multiple
  `-name` predicates.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  find . -name '*.jpg' -name '*.JPG' -print
  find . -name '*.[Jj][Pp][Gg]' -print
  ```

#### 1.2.11.5. Finding Files by Date

- Use the `-mtime` predicate to check the date of last modification of a file.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  find . -name '*.jpg' -mtime +90 -print
  ```

- The `-mtime` predicate takes an argument to specify the time frame for the search. The `90` stands for 90 days. By
  using a `+`, we are able to look for a file modified more than 90 days ago. Write `-90` for less than 90 days. Use
  neither to mean exactly 90 days.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The `find` utility also has logical *AND*, *OR*, and *NOT* constructs, so you can create a `find` command like the
  following example if you'd want to know that a file was last modified at least 7 days but not more than 14 days.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  find . -mtime +7 -a -mtime -14 -print
  ```

- You can get even more complicated, using *OR* as well as *AND* and even *NOT* to combine predicates. The following
  example will print out the names of files ending in `.text` that are older than 14 days, as well as those that are
  newer than 14 days but have `.txt` as their last 4 characters.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  find . -mtime +14 -name '*.text' -o \( -mtime -14 -name '*.txt' \) -print
  ```

- You will likely need parentheses to get the precedence right. Parentheses have a special meaning in `bash`, so we
  need to escape that meaning and write them as `\(` and `\)` or inside of single quotes (`'('` and `')'`). You cannot
  use single quotes around the entire expression, as that will confuse the `find` command. It wants each predicate as
  its own word.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.11.6. Finding Files by Type

- Use the `-type` predicate to to specify the type of a file to discover using the `find` command. It must be passed
  first, after the name of the directory in which to discover files.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  find . -type d -name '*java*' -print
  ```

- There are several types of files for which you can check.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  | **Key** |      **Meaning**       |
  | :-----: | :--------------------: |
  |   `b`   |   Block special file   |
  |   `c`   | Character special file |
  |   `d`   |       Directory        |
  |   `p`   |    Pipe (or "fifo")    |
  |   `f`   |       Plain file       |

#### 1.2.11.7. Finding File by Size

- Use the `-size` predicate in the `find` command to select files above, below, or of exactly a certain size.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  find . -size +3000k -print
  ```

- The `-size` predicate's numeric argument can be preceded by a minus sign, a plus sign, or no sign at all to indicate
  less than, greater than, or exactly equal to the numeric argument.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The size indicated includes a unit of `k` for kilobytes. `c` can be used for bytes (or "characters"). If you use `b`,
  but don't put any unit, that indicates a size in blocks.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.11.8. Finding Files by Content

- Use the `-exec` predicate on `find`so that if the predicates are true up to that point, it will execute a command
  for each file it finds. Invoke the `grep` utility in the `-exec` predicate to find a file with some known content.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  find . -name '*.txt' -exec grep --with-filename --ignore-case portend '{}' \;
  ```

#### 1.2.11.9. Finding Existing Files & Content Fast

- Using `locate` or `slocate` will help search for files without having to wait for a long `find` command to complete,
  as well as search for a file with specific content.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `locate` and `slocate` consult database files about the system (usually compiled and updated by a `cron` job) to
  find file or command names almost instantly.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `slocate` stores permission information (in additional to file names and paths), so it will not list programs to
  which the user does not have access.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- On most Linux systems, `locate` is a symbolic link to `slocate`; other systems may have separate programs, or may
  not have `slocate` at all.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Both `locate` and `slocate` are command-line tools that crawl and index the entire file systems, but they only
  contain file names and locations.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.11.10. Finding a File Using a List of Possible Locations

- `source` a file located somewhere on the `$PATH`. `bash`'s builtin `source` command will search the `$PATH` if the
  `sourcepath` shell option is set, which it is by default.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  source my_file
  ```

- Use `type -P` to search the `$PATH` if you want to execute a file and you know it exists in the `$PATH`, is
  executable and you have `bash` version 2.05b or higher. Unlike the `which` command, `type -P` only produces an output
  when it finds the file.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  LS=$(type -P ls)
  if [ -x "$LS" ]; then
    # commands involving $LS here
  fi
  ```

- An alternative of the previous example, without the explicit `if` statement.

  ```bash
  LS=$(type -P ls)
  [ -x "$LS" ] && $LS
  ```

- Use a `for` loop if you need to look in a variety of locations, possibly including the `$PATH`. Use the variable
  substitution operator to search each of the elements of the `$PATH`: `${variable//pattern/replacement}`. This will
  replace all the `:` separators with a space, thereby rendering them as separate words, allowing the `for` loop to
  iterate over a list of words.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  for path in ${PATH//:/ }; do
    [ -x "$path/ls" ] && $path/ls
  done
  ```

- To search the `$PATH` and other possible locations, list them in the `for` statement.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  for path in ${PATH//:/ } /opt/foo/bin /opt/bar/bin; do
    [ -x "$path/ls" ] && $path/ls
  done
  ```

- The `which` utility behaves differently on different systems. The Red Hat `which` is aliased to provide details when
  the argument is an alias and to set various command-line switches, and it return a not found message (while `which`
  on Debian or FreeBSD does not).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

### 1.2.12. Additional Features for Scripting

- Many scripts are written as simple one-off scripts that are only used by their author, consisting of only a few
  lines - perhaps only a single loop, if that.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Some scripts are heavy-duty that will see a lot of use from a variety of users. Such scripts will often need to take
  advantage of features that allow for better sharing and reuse of code.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.12.1. "Daemon-ising" Your Script

- Sometimes you want a script to run as a *daemon*, in the background and never-ending. To do this properly, you need
  to be able to detach your script from the terminal session used to start the daemon. Simply putting an ampersand on
  the command simply isn't enough. If you start your daemon script on a remote session, you'll notice when you log out,
  the remote session doesn't end and your window is hung until that script ends (which, being a daemon, it won't).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Use either of the following to invoke your script, run it in the background, and still allow yourself to log out.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  nohup my_daemon_script 0<&-1>/dev/null 2>&1 &
  nohup my_daemon_script >>/var/log/myadmin.log 2>&1 <&- &
  ```

- The controlling terminal needs to be closed. It is connected in three ways to any job: via standard input (STDIN),
  standard output (STDOUT), and standard error (STDERR). We can close STDOUT and STDERR by pointing them at another
  file. The cleanest way to deal with STDIN is to close the file descriptor. The `bash` syntax to do that is like a
  redirect, but with a dash for the file name (`0<&` or `<&-`).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- We use the `nohup` command so the script is run without being interrupted by a hangup signal when we log off.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.12.2. Reusing Code with Includes & Sourcing

- Use the `bash` shell's `source` command or POSIX's single period (`.`) to read in the contents of a configuration
  file when you wish to use a set of common shell variable assignments across a set of scripts.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- An example of some configuration data.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ cat myprefs.cfg
  SCRATCH_DIR=/var/tmp
  IMG_FMT=png
  SND_FMT=ogg
  $
  ```

- A simple script consisting of three arguments, using the values from the configuration file in the previous code
  example.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  source $HOME/myprefs.cfg
  cd ${SCRATCH_DIR:-/tmp}
  echo You prefer $IMG_FMT image files
  echo You prefer $SND_FMT sound files
  ```

- Sourcing is both a powerful and dangerous feature of `bash` scripting. It gives you a way to create a configuration
  file and then share that file among several scripts. With that mechanism, you can change your configuration by
  editing one file, not several scripts.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The contents of the configuration file are not limited to simple variable assignment. Any valid shell command is
  legal syntax, because when you `source` a file like this, it is simply getting its input from a different source; it
  is still the `bash` shell processing `bash` commands. Regardless of the shell commands in that `source`d file - e.g.,
  loops, or invoking other commands - it is all legitimate shell input and will be run as if it were part of your
  script.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ cat myprefs.cfg
  SCRATCH_DIR=/var/tmp
  IMG_FMT=$(cat $HOME/my_image.pref)
  if [ -e /media/mp3 ]
  then
    SND_FMT=mp3
  else
    SND_FMT=ogg
  fi
  echo config file loaded

  $
  ```

- One of the best uses of sourcing scripts comes when you define `bash` functions. These functions can then be shared
  as a common library of functions among all the scripts that source the script of function definitions.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.12.3. Using Configuration Files in a Script

- If you want to use multiple external configuration files for one or more scripts, you could write a lot of code to
  parse some configuration file format.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You may need to give a little through to how you can reduce all of your configuration requirements to `bash`-legal
  syntax.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - In a config file.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    VERBOSE=0 # 0 or '' for off, 1 for on
    SSH_USER='example_username' # Note trailing @, set to '' to use the current user
    ```

  - In a script.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    [ "$VERBOSE" ] || echo "Verbose msg from $0 goes to STDERR" >&2
    [...]
    ssh $SSH_USER$REMOTE_HOST [...]
    ```

- Depending on the user to get the configuration file correct can be risky, so instead of requiring the user to read
  the command and add the trailing `@` can be done in the script.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # If $SSH_USER is set and doesn't have a trailing @ add it:
  [ -n "$SSH_USER" -a "$SSH_USER" = "${SSH_USER%@}" ] && SSH_USER="$SSH_USER@"
  ```

- Or, as an alternative to the previous example. The `bash` variable operator `:+` will do the following: if
  `$SSH_USER` has a value, it will return the value to the right of the `:+` (in this case, we specified the variable
  itself along with an extra `@`); otherwise, if unset or empty, it will return nothing.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  ssh ${SSH_USER:+${SSH_USER}@}${REMOTE_HOST} [...]
  ```

#### 1.2.12.4. Defining Functions

- Functions in `bash` may be defined in several ways.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  function usage () {
    printf "usage: %s [ -a | - b ] file_1 ... file_n\n" ${0##*/} > &2
  }

  function usage {
    printf "usage: %s [ -a | - b ] file_1 ... file_n\n" ${0##*/} > &2
  }

  usage () {
    printf "usage: %s [ -a | - b ] file_1 ... file_n\n" ${0##*/} > &2
  }
  ```

- Either the reserved word `function` or the trailing literal `()` must be present. Using either makes the other one
  options.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The function definition should go at the top of your shell script, or at least somewhere before you need to invoke
  the function. The definition is, in a sense, just another `bash` statement. If you invoke the function before it is
  defined, you will get a "command not found" error.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.12.5. Using Functions: Parameters & Return Values

- You don''t put parentheses around the arguments of a function like you might expect from some programming languages.
  Instead, put any parameters for a `bash` function right after the function's name, separated by whitespace, just as
  if you were invoking any shell script or command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Define the function:
  function max ()
  { ... }

  # Call the function:
  max 128 $SIM
  max $VAR $CNT
  ```

- You have two ways to get values back from a function.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - First, you can assign values to variables inside the body of your function. Those variables will be global to the
    whole script unless they are explicitly declared `local` within the function.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    # Cookbook Filename: func_max.1

    # Define the function:
    function max () {
      local HIDN
      if [ $1 -gt $2 ]
      then
        BIGR=$1
      else
        BIGR=$2
      fi
      HIDN=5
    }

    # Call the function:
    max 128 $SIM

    # Use the result:
    echo $BIGR
    ```

  - The other way is to use `echo` or `printf` to send the output to standard output. You must invoke the function
    inside a `$()` - capturing the output and using the result - otherwise it will be wasted on the screen.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    # Cookbook Filename: func_max.2

    # Define the function:
    function max ()
    {
      if [ $1 -gt $2 ]
      then
        echo $1
      else
        echo $2
      fi
    }

    # Call the function:
    BIGR=$(max 128 $SIM)

    # Use the result
    echo $BIGR
    ```

- Within the parameters are referred to as if they were command-line arguments by using `$1`, `$2`, etc. However, `$0`
  must be ignored. It remains the name by which the entire script was invoked, just like in the rest of the script.
  After exiting from the script, `$1`, `$2`, etc., go back to referring to the parameters with which the script was
  invoked.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The first element of the `$FUNCNAME` array refers to the name of the function. It is to a function, just like `$0`
  is to a script, except without all the path information. The rest of the array elements amounts to a call stack,
  with "main" as the bottom or last element. This `$FUNCNAME` only exists while a function is executing.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Returning values by setting variables is more efficient than returning variables, and it can also handle lots of
  data - many variables can be set - but the approach has its drawbacks. It requires that the function and the rest of
  the script agree on variable names for the information hand-off.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- using the output as the way to return values does reduce the coupling from settings values, but it is limited in its
  usefulness - it is limited in how much data it can return before your script has to spend lots of effort parsing the
  result of the function.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.12.6. Trapping Interrupts

- Use the `trap` utility to set signal handlers. They trap signals and respond to them accordingly.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Use `trap -l` (or `kill -l`) to list the signals you may trap. They vary between systems.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The exist status of a script will be *128 + `signal_number`* if the command was terminated by the signal
  `signal_number`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The following example is rather hard to kill, because the signals trapped using the `trap` keywords will be ignored.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # cookbook filename: hard_to_kill

  function trapped {
    if [ "$1" = "USR1" ]; then
      echo "Got me with a $1 trap!"
      exit
    else
      echo "Received $1 trap--neener, neener"
    fi
  }

  trap "trapped ABRT" ABRT
  trap "trapped EXIT" EXIT
  trap "trapped HUP" HUP
  trap "trapped INT" INT
  trap "trapped KILL" KILL # This won't actually work
  trap "trapped QUIT" QUIT
  trap "trapped TERM" TERM
  trap "trapped USR1" USR1 # This one is special

  # Just hang out and do nothing, without introducing "third-party"
  # trap behaviour, such as if we used 'sleep'
  while (( 1 )); do
    : # : is a NOOP
  done
  ```

- Invoking the example script from the previous code example and then trying to kill it.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ ./hard_to_kill
  ^CReceived INT trap--neener, neener
  ^CReceived INT trap--neener, neener
  ^CReceived INT trap--neener, neener
  ^Z
  [1]+ Stopped ./hard_to_kill

  $ kill -TERM %1
  [1]+ Stopped ./hard_to_kill
  Received TERM trap--neener, neener

  $ jobs
  [1]+ Stopped ./hard_to_kill

  $ bg
  [1]+ ./hard_to_kill &

  $ jobs
  [1]+ Running ./hard_to_kill &

  $ kill -TERM %1
  Received TERM trap--neener, neener

  $ kill -HUP %1
  Received HUP trap--neener, neener

  $ kill -USR1 %1
  Got me with a USR1 trap!
  Received EXIT trap--neener, neener
  [1]+ Done ./hard_to_kill
  ```

- You can't actually trap `-SIGKILL` (`-9`). That signal kills processes dead immediately, so they have no choice to
  trap anything. This signal does not allow the script or program to clean up or shut down gracefully at any points.
  That's often a bad thing, so try to avoid using `kill -KILL` unless you have no other choice.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The usage for `trap` is as follows:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  trap [-lp] [arg] [signal [signal]]
  ```

  - The `arg` argument is the code to execute when the given `signal` is received. That code can be self-contained, or
    it can be a call to a function. If the argument is the `null` string, the given signal(s) will be ignored. If the
    signal is `-` or missing, but one or more signals are listed, they will be reset to the shell defaults.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `-l` lists the signal names.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `-p` will print any current traps and their handlers.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- When using more than one trap handler, it is recommended to alphabetise the signal names to improve readability and
  discoverability of those signals.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- There are three pseudo-signals for various special purposes.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The `DEBUG` signal is similar to `EXIT`, but is used before every command for debugging purposes.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The `RETURN` signal is triggered when execution resumes after a function or `source (.)` call.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The `ERR` signal is triggered after a simple command fails..
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.12.7. Redefining Commands with `alias`

- Use the `alias` feature of `bash` for interactive shells (only). It can be used to slightly alter the definition of a
  command, perhaps so that you always use a particular option on the command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Type `alias` with no other arguments so that you can see the list of aliases that are already defined for you in your
  `bash` session. Some `bash` installations may already have several available for you.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Using single quotes when assigning an `alias` means the variable will not be evaluated when the definition of the
  `alias` is made. The string substitution will only occur when the command is run, and only then with the variable be
  evaluated. This means changing the definition of a variable will update its value in future usages of the `alias`
  using the variable.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  alias h='ls $HOME'
  alias h='ls ~'
  ```

- If you use double quotes when assigning an `alias`, then the substitution of the variable's value would be made right
  away and the `alias` would be made right away and the `alias` would be defined with the substituted value of the
  variable.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  alias h="ls $HOME"
  alias h="ls ~"
  ```

- Use `unalias` and the name of the alias you no longer want if you don't like what your alias does and want to get rid
  of it.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Use `unalias -a` to remove all the alias definitions in your current shell session. The backslash (`\`) prefix
  disables `alias` expansion for any command, so it is standard security best practice to preface the `\unalias`
  command in case the `unalias` keyword would have been aliased by someone else.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ alias unalias=':'

  $ alias unalias
  alias unalias=':'

  $ unalias unalias

  $ alias unalias
  alias unalias=':'

  $ \unalias unalias

  $ alias unalias
  bash: alias: unalias: not found
  ```

- Aliases do not allow arguments do be passed at runtime.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.12.8. Avoiding Aliases & Functions

- In the case where you've written an alias or function to override a real function a real command, use the `bash`
  shell's `builtin` command to ignore functions and aliases and run an actual builtin command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Use the `command` command to ignore shell functions and aliases and run an actual external command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If you only want to avoid alias expansion, but still allow function definitions to be considered, then prefix the
  command with `\` to just prevent alias expansion.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Use the `type` command to determine what you've got.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Some examples from the commands identified so far in this section.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ alias echo='echo ~~~'

  $ echo test
  ~~~ test

  $ \echo test
  test

  $ builtin echo test
  test

  $ type echo
  echo is aliased to `echo ~~~'

  $ unalias echo

  $ type echo
  echo is a shell builtin

  $ type -a echo
  echo is a shell builtin
  echo is /bin/echo

  $ echo test
  test
  ```

- A function with the same name as a builtin function. The `builtin` command tells `bash` to assume the command that
  follows is a shell builtin command and not to use any alias or function definition.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  function cd () {
    if [[ $1 = "..." ]]
    then
      builtin cd ../..
    else
      builtin cd "$1"
    fi
  }
  ```

- The `type` command will not only tell us that an alias is an alias, but show us the alias definition. Similarly, with
  function definitions, the actual body of the function will be shown.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If your function name is that of an executable, like `ls`, and not a builtin command, then you can override any alias
  and/or function by just referring to the full path to the executable, such as `/bin/ls` rather than just as the `ls`
  command. If you don't know its full path, just prefix the command with the keyword `command`. Note that the `$PATH`
  variable will still be used to determine the location of the command. If you are running the wrong `ls` because of
  your `$PATH` has some unexpected values, adding `command` will not help in that situation.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.12.9. Counted Elapsed Time

- Use the `time` builtin or the `bash` variable `$SECONDS` to display how long a script, or an operation in a script,
  takes.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `time` reports the time used by a process or pipeline in a variety of ways.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ time sleep 4
  real 0m4.029s
  user 0m0.000s
  sys 0m0.000s

  $ time sha256sum /bin/* &> /dev/null
  real 0m1.252s
  user 0m0.072s
  sys 0m0.028s
  ```

- You can use `time` for command or functions inside a script, but you can't time the entire script from inside itself.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If you just want to know how long the entire script took to execute, you can use `$SECONDS`. `$SECONDS` expands to
  the number of seconds since the shell was started. Assignment to this variable resets the count to the value
  assigned, and the expanded value becomes the value assigned plus the number of seconds since the assignment.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ cat seconds
  started="$SECONDS"
  sleep 4
  echo "Run-time = $(($SECONDS - $started)) seconds..."

  $ bash seconds
  Run-time = 4 seconds...
  $ time bash seconds
  Run-time = 4 seconds...
  real 0m4.003s
  user 0m0.000s
  sys 0m0.000s
  ```

#### 1.2.12.10. Writing Wrappers

- If you have a series of related commands or tools that you often need to use in an ad hoc manner, and you want to
  collect them in once place to make them easier to use and remember, write a shell script "wrapper" using `case..esac`
  blocks as needed.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- There are two basic ways to handle needs like this. Both approaches have merit, but the second option tends to be
  better because you only have to remember the single prefix command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - One is to write several tiny shell scripts, or perhaps aliases, to handle all the needs.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The other is like the majority of revision control tools, where you call a single binary like a "prefix", then add
    the action or command/
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Some of the basic considerations for the wrapper implementation are as follows:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Simple to read and understand.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

### 1.2.13. Working with Dates & Times

- Regardless of whether you're writing a shell script or a much larger program, timekeeping is full of complexities:
  different formats for displaying the time and date, Daylight Saving Time, leap years, leap seconds, etc.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Computers are very good at keeping time accurately, particularly if they are using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) to
  keep themselves synced with national and international time standards. They're also great at understanding the
  variations in Daylight Saving Time from locale to locale.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- To work with time in a shell script, use the Unix `date` command (or, even better, the GNU version of the `date`
  command). `date` is capable of displaying dates in different formats and even doing arithmetic correctly.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `gawk` (the GNU version of `awk`) has the same `strftime` formatting as the GNU `date` command. The GNU `date` it
  much easier to use than the `gawk`, but keep `gawk` in mind if you are using a system that has `gawk` but not `date`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.13.1. Formatting Dates for Display

- Use the `date` command with a `strftime` format specification when you need to format dates or times for output.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Setting environment variables can be helpful in scripts:
  $ STRICT_ISO_8601='%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z' # Strict ISO 8601 format
  $ ISO_8601='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z'       # Almost ISO8601, but more human-readable
  $ ISO_8601_1='%Y-%m-%d %T %Z'           # %T is the same as %H:%M:%S
  $ DATEFILE='%Y%m%d%H%M%S'               # Suitable for use in a filename

  $ date "+$ISO_8601"
  2006-05-08 14:36:51 CDT

  $ gawk "BEGIN {print strftime(\"$ISO_8601\")}"
  2006-12-07 04:38:54 EST

  # Same as previous $ISO_8601
  $ date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z'
  2006-05-08 14:36:51 CDT

  $ date -d '2005-11-06' "+$ISO_8601"
  2005-11-06 00:00:00 CST

  $ date "+Program starting at: $ISO_8601"
  Program starting at: 2006-05-08 14:36:51 CDT

  $ printf "%b" "Program starting at: $(date '+$ISO_8601')\n"
  Program starting at: $ISO_8601

  $ echo "I can rename a file like this: mv file.log file_$(date +$DATEFILE).log"
  I can rename a file like this: mv file.log file_20060508143724.log
  ```

- On some systems, the `date` command is more picky about the placement of the `+` than on others. It is recommended to
  explicitly add the `+` to the `date` command rather than in the environment variables.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Unless otherwise specified, the time zone is assumed to be the local time, as defined by your system. The `%z` format
  is a non-standard extension used by the GNU `date` command; it may not work on your system.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- *ISO 8601* is the recommended is the recommended standard for displaying dates and times and should be used if all
  possible.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - It is a recognised standard.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - It is unambiguous.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - It is easy to read while still being easy to parse programmatically (e.g., using `awk` or `cut`).
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - It sorts as expected when used in columnar data or in file names.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Try to avoid *DD/MM/YY* or *MM/DD/YY* (or, even worse, *D/M/YY* or *M/D/YY*) date formats. They do not sort well, and
  they are ambiguous, since either the day or the month may come first depending on geographical location, also making
  them hard to parse.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Use 24-hour time when possible to avoid even more ambiguity and parsing problems.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.13.2. Supplying a Default Date

- If you want your script to provide a useful default date, and perhaps prompt the user to verify it, use the GNU
  `date` command, assign the most likely date to a variable, then then allow the user to change it.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # cookbook filename: default_date

  # Use noon time to prevent a script running around midnight and a clock a
  # few seconds off from causing off by one day errors.

  START_DATE=$(date -d 'last week Monday 12:00:00' '+%Y-%m-%d')
  while [ 1 ]; do
    printf "%b" "The starting date is $START_DATE, is that correct? (Y/new date)"
    read answer

    # Anything other than ENTER, "Y", or "y" is validated as a new date
    # Could use "[Yy]*" to allow the user to spell out "yes"...
    # Validate the new date format as: YY-MM-DD

    case "$answer" in
      [Yy]) break
        ;;
      [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9])
        printf "%b" "Overriding $START_DATE with $answer\n"
        START_DATE="$answer"
        ;;
      *) printf "%b" "Invalid date, please try again...\n"
        ;;
    esac
  done

  END_DATE=$(date -d "$START_DATE +7 days" '+%Y-%m-%d')

  echo "START_DATE: $START_DATE"
  echo "END_DATE: $END_DATE"
  ```

- Not all `date` commands support the `-d` option, but the GNU version does. It is best to obtain and user the GNU
  `date` command if at all possible.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Leave out the user verification code if your script is running unattended or at a known time (e.g., from `cron`).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Code like the code block in this section is used in scripts that generate SQL queries. The script runs at a given
  time and creates an SQL query for a specific date range to generate a report.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.13.3. Automating Date Ranges

- If you have one date, you can generate another automatically.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The GNU `date` command is very powerful and flexible, but the power of `-d` isn't documented well. Your system may
  document it under `getdate`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The following are some examples.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z'
  2005-11-05 01:03:00 -0500

  $ date -d 'today' '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z'
  2005-11-05 01:04:39 -0500

  $ date -d 'yesterday' '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z'
  2005-11-04 01:04:48 -0500

  $ date -d 'tomorrow' '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z'

  $ date -d 'Monday' '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z'
  2005-11-07 00:00:00 -0500

  $ date -d 'this Monday' '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z'

  2005-11-09 01:06:23 -0500

  $ date -d '-6 days' '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z'
  2005-10-30 01:06:30 -0400

  $ date -d '2000-01-01 +12 days' '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z'

  $ date -d '3 months 1 day' '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z'
  2006-02-06 01:03:00 -0500
  ```

- The `-d` option allows you to specify a date instead of using "now", but not all `date` commands support it. The GNU
  version does, and it is recommended to use that version if at all possible.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - If you run the `date -d` command on a Saturday, you would expect to see the next Saturday, but you would instead
    get the present day.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    $ date -d 'next Saturday' '+%a %Y-%m-%d'
    Sat 2005-11-05
    ```

  - Also watch out for `this week <day>`, because as soon as the specified day is in the past, this week becomes next
    week.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    $ date -d 'this week Friday' '+%a %Y-%m-%d'
    Fri 2005-11-11
    ```

- If you don't have GNU `date`, you may find the following shell functions' presented in the
  ["Shell Corner: Date-Related Shell Functions"](
    https://www.drdobbs.com/shell-corner-date-related-shell-function/199102857) issue of the Unix Review.

#### 1.2.13.4. Converting Dates & Times to Epoch Seconds

- Epoch seconds are the number of seconds since the epoch: *midnight, 1st of January, 1970*, also known as
  *970-01-01T00:00:00*.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Use the GNU `date` command with the non-standard `--date=STRING` option and a standard `%s` format when you want to
  convert a date and time to epoch seconds to make it easier to do date and time arithmetic. The
  `date [--date=STRING] '+%s'` command starts at the epoch, adds the epoch seconds, and displays the date and time as
  you wish.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # "Now" is easy
  $ date '+%s'
  1131172934

  # Some other time needs the non-standard -d
  $ date --date="2005-11-05 12:00:00 +0000" '+%s'
  1131192000
  ```

#### 1.2.13.5. Converting Epoch Seconds to Dates & Times

- Use the GNU `date` command with your desired format to convert epoch seconds to a human-readable date and time.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ EPOCH='1131173989'
  $ date --date="1970-01-01 UTC $EPOCH seconds" +"%Y-%m-%d %T %z"

  2005-11-05 01:59:49 -0500
  $ date --utc --date="1970-01-01 $EPOCH seconds" +"%Y-%m-%d %T %z"
  2005-11-05 06:59:49 +0000
  ```

#### 1.2.13.6. Getting Yesterday or Tomorrow with Perl

- You may need to get yesterday or tomorrow's date, and you have Perl but not GNU `date` on your system, you can use
  Perl-one-lines, adjusting the number of seconds added to or subtracted from `time`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Yesterday at this same time (note subtraction)
  $ perl -e "use POSIX qw(strftime);
  > print strftime('%Y-%m-%d', localtime(time - 86400)), qq(\n);"
  2005-11-04

  # Tomorrow at this same time (note addition)
  $ perl -e "use POSIX qw(strftime);
  > print strftime('%Y-%m-%d', localtime(time + 86400)), qq(\n);"
  2005-11-06
  ```

#### 1.2.13.7. Figuring Out Date & Time Arithmetic

- If you can't get the answer for some kind of arithmetic with dates and times using the `date` command, convert your
  existing dates and times to epoch seconds using
  [1.2.13.4. Converting Dates \& Times to Epoch Seconds](#12134-converting-dates--times-to-epoch-seconds).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- For example, if you have a machine that is two days out of sync. That should not happen as every machine should
  already be using the Network Time Protocol, but just for the sake of argument in this example.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  CORRECTION='172800' # 2 days' worth of seconds

  # Code to extract the date portion from the data
  # into $bad_date goes here
  # Suppose it's this:

  bad_date='Jan 2 05:13:05' # syslog-formatted date

  # Convert to epoch second using GNU date
  bad_epoch=$(date -d "$bad_date" '+%s')

  # Apply correction
  good_epoch=$(( bad_epoch + $CORRECTION ))

  # Make corrected date human-readable, with GNU date
  good_date=$(date -d "1970-01-01 UTC $good_epoch seconds")
  good_date_iso=$(date -d "1970-01-01 UTC $good_epoch seconds" +'%Y-%m-%d %T')
  Date
  echo "bad_date: $bad_date"
  echo "bad_epoch: $bad_epoch"
  echo "Correction: +$CORRECTION"
  echo "good_epoch: $good_epoch"
  echo "good_date: $good_date"
  echo "good_date_iso: $good_date_iso"

  # Code to insert the $good_date back into the data goes here
  ```

- Dealing with any kind of arithmetic is much easier using epoch seconds than any other format. You don't need to worry
  about hours, days, weeks, or years; you just do some simple addition or subtraction and you're all set. Using epoch
  seconds also avoids all the rules about leap years and leap seconds, and if you standardise on one time zone (usually
  UTC, formerly known as GMT), you can even avoid time zones.

#### 1.2.13.8. Handling Time Zones, Daylight Saving Time, & Leap Years

- Instead of wanting to account for time zones, Daylight Saving Time, and leap years or seconds, don't actually do
  that. Use a tool instead of having to find and resolve the many intricacies of multiple time zones, Daylight Saving
  Time, and leap years or seconds.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.13.9. Using `date` & `cron` to Run a Script on the Nth Day

- Most `cron`s will not allow running a script on the Nth weekday of the month, e.g., the second Wednesday.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Use a bit of shell code in the command to be run. Adapt one of the following lines in your Linux Vixie-cron
  `crontab`. If you are using another `cron` program, you may need to convert the day of the week to numbers according
  to the schedule your `cron` uses.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Vixie-cron
  # Min Hour DoM Mnth DoW Program
  # 0-59 0-23 1-31 1-12 0-7

  # Vixie-cron requires % to be escaped or you get an error!

  # Run the first Wednesday @ 23:00
  00 23 1-7 * Wed [ "$(date '+\%a')" == "Wed" ] && /path/to/command args to command

  # Run the second Thursday @ 23:00
  00 23 8-14 * Thu [ "$(date '+\%a')" == "Thu" ] && /path/to/command

  # Run the third Friday @ 23:00
  00 23 15-21 * Fri [ "$(date '+\%a')" == "Fri" ] && /path/to/command

  # Run the fourth Saturday @ 23:00
  00 23 22-27 * Sat [ "$(date '+\%a')" == "Sat" ] && /path/to/command

  # Run the fifth Sunday @ 23:00
  00 23 28-31 * Sun [ "$(date '+\%a')" == "Sun" ] && /path/to/command
  ```

- Note that any given day of the week doesn't always happen five times during one month.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Most versions of `cron` (including Linux's Vixie-cron) do not allow you to schedule a job on the Nth day of the
  month. To work around that issue, we schedule the job to run during the range of days when the Nth day (that we'd
  need) occurs. For example, "second Wednesday of the month" must occur somewhere in the range of the 8th to the 14th
  of the month, meaning that we run every day and see if it's Wednesday. If so, we execute our command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Day ranges for each week of a month.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  | **Week** | **Day Range** |
  | :------: | :-----------: |
  |  First   |      1-7      |
  |  Second  |     8-14      |
  |  Third   |     15-21     |
  |  Fourth  |     22-27     |
  |  Fifth   |     28-31     |

#### 1.2.13.10. Logging with Dates

- When you want to output logs or other lines with dates, but you want to avoid the overhead of shelling out to the
  `date` command, you can use `printf` for dates and times.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- As of `bash` 4 or newer, you can use `printf '$(fmt)T'` for dates and times.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You can also use `printf` to assign to a variable, so you can easily reuse it.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # The variable `today` is set with the following command.
  printf -v today '%(%F)T' '-1'
  ```

- The `'-1'` argument is important, but it is inconsistent. `-1` represents the current time, and `-2` represents the
  time the shell was invoked. However, the default behaviour changed between `bash` 4.2 and 4.3. In 4.2, a null
  argument is treated as null, which return the local time at the Unix epoch, which is almost certainly not what you
  want or expect. In `bash` 4.3, there is a special exception so that a null argument is treated as a `'-1'` argument.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ echo $BASH_VERSION
  4.2.37(1)-release

  $ printf '%(%F %T %Z)T; Foo Bar\n'
  1969-12-31 19:00:00 EST; Foo Bar

  $ printf '%(%F %T %Z)T; Foo Bar\n' '-1'
  2014-11-15 15:24:26 EST; Foo Bar

  $ echo $BASH_VERSION
  4.3.11(1)-release

  $ printf '%(%F %T %Z)T; Foo Bar\n'
  2014-11-15 15:25:02 EST; Foo Bar

  $ printf '%(%F %T %Z)T; Foo Bar\n' '-1'
  2014-11-15 15:25:05 EST; Foo Bar
  ```

- The `printf` in `bash` is a builtin command, but there is also a separate binary executable called `printf` which
  isn't the same. The separate executable is for other shell that don't have a builtin `printf`. Don't confuse the
  manpage for `printf` with the description of `printf` that is part of the `bash` manpage. Though there are large
  similarities between the two, the latter is what you want.

### 1.2.14. End-User Tasks as Shell Scripts

- The scripts in this section are intended to give useful, real-world examples of actual uses of shell scripts beyond
  just system administration tasks.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.14.1. Starting Simple by Printing Dashes

- The following code block is a simple script that prints a line of dashes, by building a string of the required number
  of dashes (or an alternate character) and then printing that string to standard output (STDOUT). The default values
  are set early in the script, before the `while` loop. All the other lines deal with argument parsing, error checking,
  user messages, and comments.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # cookbook filename: dash
  # dash - print a line of dashes
  # options: # how many (default 72)
  #   -c X use char X instead of dashes
  #
  function usagexit (){
    # Use the string manipulation operator with a pattern (*/) to trim off any leading path name characters when
    # displaying this script's name. That ensures the script will still be referred to as just the script file's name,
    # no matter where the user executes the script.
    printf "usage: %s [-c X] [#]\n" ${0##*/}
    exit 2
  } >&2

  # Setting the default values.
  LEN=72
  CHAR='-'

  # Performing the argument parsing while are still arguments to parse.
  while (( $# > 0 ))
  do
    case $1 in
    [0-9]*) LEN=$1;;
      -c) # A "-c" option following by a character, to be used instead of a dash.
        shift
        CHAR=$1
        ;;
      *) # Any options other than characters.
        usagexit # The usage message, and an early exit of the script.
        ;;
    esac

    # Decrementing the number of arguments and eventually get the script out of the `while` loop.
    shift
  done

  # Enforcing a maximum length of the script.
  if (( LEN > 4096 ))
  then
    echo "too large" >&2
    exit 3
  fi

  # build the string to the exact length
  DASHES=""
  for ((i=0; i<LEN; i++))
  do
    DASHES="${DASHES}${CHAR}"
  done

  printf "%s\n" "$DASHES"
  ```

- Even simple scripts can become very complicated, mostly due to error checking, argument parsing, etc.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- For scripts that you write for yourself, such techniques are often neglected, as there is no need to add robust error
  checking and fancy error messages if you are the only user. For script that you want to share, that is not the case,
  and care and effort should be considered when writing your script to fail without issue.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.14.2. Viewing Photos in an Album

- If you have a directory full of images, and you want a quick and easy way to view them all, you can write a shell
  script that will generate a set of HTML pages so that you can view your photos with a browser. The example in this
  section is called `mk_album` and is intended to be stored in your `~/bin` directory.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- On the command, `cd` into the directory where you want to create the album (typically where your photos are located).
  Then run a command to generate the list of photos that you want included in this album, and pipe this output into the
  `mk_album` shell script. You need to put the name of the album (i.e., the name of the directory that will be created
  by the script) on the command line as the only argument to the shell script.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  ls *.jpg | mk_album rugby_match
  ```

- The following code block is the shell script (called `mk_album`) that will generate a set of HTML pages for your
  album, one page per image.

  # The EMIT function emits the HTML for each page of the album. Each page is its own (static) web page, with
  # hyperlinks to the previous and next image, as well as links to the first and last image. The EMIT function doesn't
  # know much; it is given the names of all the images to link, and it takes those names and converts them to page

#### 1.2.14.3. Loading Your MP3 Player

- If you have a collection of MP3 files that you would like to add to your MP3 plater, but you have more music than can
  fit in its storage, you can use a shell script to keep track of the available space as it copies files onto the MP3
  plater, quitting when it is full.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # cookbook filename: load_mp3
  # Fill up my mp3 player with as many songs as will fit.
  # N.B.: This assumes that the mp3 player is mounted on /media/mp3
  #

  #
  # determine the size of a file
  #
  function FILESIZE () {
    FN=${1:-/dev/null}
    if [[ -e $FN ]]
    then
    # FZ=$(stat -c '%b' "$FN")
    set -- $(ls -s "$FN")
    FZ=$1
    fi
  }

  #
  # compute the free space on the mp3 player
  #
  function CALCULATE_FREE_SPACE {
    # FREE=$(df /media/mp3 | awk '/^\/dev/ {print $4}')
    set -- $(df /media/mp3 | grep '^/dev/')
    FREE=$4
  }

  # subtract the (given) file size from the (global) free space
  function REDUCE ()
  (( FREE-=${1:-0})) # this works, but is unusual

  #
  # main:
  #
  let SUM=0
  let COUNT=0
  export FZ
  export FREE

  CALCULATE_FREE_SPACE

  # The `find` command will locate all the files with an `.mp3` file extension. This information is then piped to the
  # `while` loop on the next line. The `while` loop and `printf` command are wrapped inside of parentheses, meaning the
  # statements inside them will be run inside of a subshell. Putting the `while` and `printf` inside of a sub-shell
  # means they are both now executing in the same shell environment and can share variables. A similar effect can be
  # accomplished with braces.
  find . -name '*.mp3' -print | \
  ( while read PATH_NAME
    do
      FILESIZE "$PATH_NAME"

      if ((FZ <= FREE))
      then
        echo loading $PATH_NAME

        cp "$PATH_NAME" /media/mp3

        if (( $? == 0 ))
        then
          let SUM+=FZ
          let COUNT++
          REDUCE $FZ
        else
          echo "bad copy of $PATH_NAME to /media/mp3"

    printf "loaded %d songs (%d blocks)" $COUNT $SUM

    printf " onto /media/mp3 (%d blocks free)\n" $FREE
  )
  # end of script
  ```

- The script in this will copy any MP3 file from the current directory on down, towards the leaf nodes of the tree onto
  an MP3 player (or other device) mounted on `/media/mp3`. The script will try to determine the free space on the
  device before it begins its copying, and then it will subtract the disk size of copied items so as to know when to
  quit (i.e., when the device is full, or as full as possible).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The script can be invoked with the following command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  load_mp3
  ```

#### 1.2.14.4. Burning a CD

- If you have a directory full of files on your Linux system that you would like to burn to a CD, you can do that with
  two open source programs called `mkisofs` and `cdrecord`, and a `bash` script to organise the options.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Start by putting all the files that you want to copy to CD into a directory structure. The following script takes
  that directory as an argument, makes an ISO file system image from those files, then burn the ISO image to the CD.
  The following is an example of shell scripting, but it may not work on your system. It is not intended as a workable
  CD recording and backup mechanism.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # cookbook filename: cd_script
  # cd_script - prep and burn a CD from a dir.
  #
  # usage: cd_script dir [ cddev ]
  #

  if (( $# < 1 || $# > 2 ))
  then
    echo 'usage: cd_script dir [ cddev ]'
    exit 2
  fi

  # set the defaults
  SRCDIR=$1

  # your device might be "ATAPI:0,0,0" or other digits
  CDDEV=${2:-"ATAPI:0,0,0"}

  # Construct a temporary file name using the `$$` variable, giving us our process number. As long as the script is
  # running, it will be the one and only process with that number, giving a name that is unique among all other running
  # processes.
  ISO_IMAGE=/tmp/cd$$.iso

  echo "building ISO image..."
  #
  # make the ISO fs image
  #
  mkisofs -A "$(cat ~/.cdAnnotation)" \
    -p "$(hostname)" -V "${SRCDIR##*/}" \
    -r -o "$ISO_IMAGE" $SRCDIR

  # Saving the status of the `mkisofs` command. This will be a `0` on a success, and a non-zero value if it fails.
  # The `$?` could be used in the `if` statement below, but setting the `STATUS` variable allows that return value to
  # be passed back out to this script's return value.
  STATUS=$?

  if (( STATUS != 0 ))
  then
    echo "Error. ISO image failed."
    echo "Investigate then remove $ISO_IMAGE"
    exit $STATUS
  fi

  echo "ISO image built; burning to cd..."

  #
  # burn the CD
  #
  SPD=8

  OPTS="-eject -v fs=64M driveropts=burnproof"

  cdrecord $OPTS -speed=$SPD dev=${CDDEV} $ISO_IMAGE

  # Saving the status of the `cdrecord` command. This will be a `0` on a success, and a non-zero value if it fails.
  # The `$?` could be used in the `if` statement below, but setting the `STATUS` variable allows that return value to
  # be passed back out to this script's return value.
  STATUS=$?

  if (( STATUS != 0 ))
  then
    echo "Error. CD Burn failed."
    echo "Investigate then remove $ISO_IMAGE"
    exit $STATUS
  fi

  rm -f $ISO_IMAGE

  echo "Done."
  ```

#### 1.2.14.5. Comparing Two Documents

- If you have two files in the OpenDocument Format (ODF), then you use can use a shell script to compare just the
  contents of both files, in the case where you need to determine what changes (if any) there are between the two
  files.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The following is a *bash* script that can be used to compare two LibreOffice files saved in an ODF format (identified
  using the *.odt* suffix), to indicate a text-oriented document, as opposed to a spreadsheet or presentation file
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash

    echo "Where both files must be .odt files"
    exit $1
  } >&2 # This line redirects all the output from this shell function to STDERR.
        # Putting the redirect on the function definition means we don't need to remember to redirect every output line
        # separately.

  if (( $# != 2 ))
  then
    usage_exit 1

### 1.2.15. Parsing & Similar Tasks

- Some of the recipes in this chapter include the parsing of command-line arguments.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Some Linux commands also allow long-form options. No long-format options will be shown in this section, but they
  could be possible using the techniques shown in this section. The best way to parse long argument is using the
  `getopt` command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.15.1. Parsing Arguments for Your Shell Script

- If you want to have some options to execute your shell script using some flags that users that users can use to
  alter its behaviour, you could do the parsing directory. You could use `${}` to tell you how many arguments have
  been supplied and using `${1:0:1}` to test the first character of the first argument to see if it's a minus sign. You
  would then need some `if`/`then` or `case` logic to identify which option it is and whether it takes an argument.
  This solution assumes a user actually supplies a required argument, and doesn't call your script with two options
  combined, e.g., `-ab`.  The best way to parse long arguments is to use the `getopt` (no `s`) command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The need to parse options for a shell script is a common situation. Lots of scripts have options. You can use
  `bash`'s builtin `getopts` command to help parse options.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # cookbook filename: getopts_example
  #
  # using getopts
  #

  a_flag=
  b_flag=

  while getopts 'ab:' OPTION
  do
    case $OPTION in
      a) a_flag=1
        ;;
      b) b_flag=1
        b_value="$OPTARG"
        ;;
      ?) printf "Usage: %s: [-a] [-b value] args\n" ${0##*/} >&2
        exit 2
        ;;
    esac
  done

  shift $(($OPTIND - 1))

  if [ "$a_flag" ]
  then
    printf "Option -a specified\n"
  fi

  if [ "$b_flag" ]
  then
    printf 'Option -b "%s" specified\n' "$b_value"
  fi

  printf "Remaining arguments are: %s\n" "$*"
  ```

- There are two kinds of options supported in the script shown in the previous code block.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The first and simpler kind is a standalone option. It typically represents a flag to modify a command's behaviour.
    For example, the `-l` option on the `ls` command.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The second kind of option requires an option. For example, the `-u` option in the `mysql` command, which requires a
    username to be supplied.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `getopts` takes two arguments: `getopts 'ab:' OPTION`. In this example, we are defining `-a` and `-b` as the only
    two valid options, so the first argument to `getopts` has just those two letters. The colon signifies that `-b`
    needs argument, like `-u <username>` or `-f <file_name>`. The only needs to be adjacent to any option letter(s)
    taking an argument.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Inside the loop in this section's previous code block example, when the parsing has found an option letter for
  parsing, we use a `case` statement on the variable `$OPTION` to set flags or otherwise take action when the option is
  encountered. For options for that arguments, that argument is placed in the shell variable `$OPTARG` (a fixed name
  not related to our use of `$OPTION` as our variable). The value of `$OPTARG` needs to be saved to another variable,
  as it will be reset on each call to `getopts` as the parsing continues to loop.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The third case in the `case` statement in this section's code block example is a question mark, a shell pattern that
  matches any single character. When `getopts` find an option that is not set in the set of expected options, it will
  return a literal question mark in the variable.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- While the `while` loop terminates in this section's code block example, the next line to be executed is:
  `shift $(($OPTIND - 1))`, which moves the positional parameters of the shell script from `$1`, `$2`, etc., down a
  given number of positions (discarding the lower ones). The variable `$OPTIND` is an index into the arguments that
  `getopts` uses to keep track of where it parses.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.15.2. Parsing Arguments with Your Own Error Messages

- You can use `getopts` to write your own error handling in the case where you don't like the error messages outputted
  when `getopts` encounters bad input.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If you want `getopts` to not report any errors at all, assign `OPTERROR=0` before you begin parsing arguments.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If you want `getopts` to give you more information without the error messages, then begin the option list with a
  colon, as shown in the following example.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - This example means that `getopt` now return a colon when an option is missing. In that case, it puts the option
    letter into `$OPTARG` to help determine what option it was that was missing its argument.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - If an unsupported option is given, `getopts` returns a question mark as the value for `$FOUND`, and puts the
    letter into `$OPTARG` so that it can be used in the error messages.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - A backslash is placed preceding the `:` and `?` to indicate that these are literals and not any special patterns
    or shell syntax.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # cookbook filename: getopts_custom
  #
  # using getopts - with custom error messages
  #

  a_flag=
  b_flag=

  # Since we don't want getopts to generate error
  # messages, but want this script to issue its
  # own messages, we will put, in the option list, a
  # leading ':' to silence getopts.

  while getopts :ab: FOUND
  do
    case $FOUND in
      a) a_flag=1

  fi

  printf "Remaining arguments are: %s\n" "$*"
  ```

#### 1.2.15.3. Parsing Some HTML

- For a quick and easy shell parse of HTML, provided it doesn't have to be foolproof, you might want to try something
  like the following.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  cat $1 | sed -e 's/>/>\
  /g' | grep '<a' | while IFS='"' read a b c ; do echo $b; done
  ```

- Parsing HTML from `bash` is pretty tricky, mainly because `bash` tends to be very line-oriented whereas HTML was
  designed to treat new lines like whitespace. So, it's not uncommon to see tags split across two or more lines, like
  the following.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```html
  <a href="blah..." rel="blah..." media="blah..."
    target= "blah..." >
  ```

- There are also two ways to write `<a>` tags, one with a separate ending `</a>` tag and one without, where instead the
  singular `<a>` tag itself ends with a `/>`. Between this and the potential for multiple tags on a line and tags split
  across lines, it's a bit messy to parse, and our simple bash technique for this is often not foolproof.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The following are the steps involved in the solution at the start of this section.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Break the multiple tags on one line into at most one line per tag. The new line right after the backslash so that
    it substitutes each end-of-tag character (i.e., the `>`) with that same character and then a new line. That will
    put tags on separate lines, with possibly additional blank lines. The trailing `g` tells `sed` to do the search and
    replace globally.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    cat file | sed -e 's/>/>\
    /g'
    ```

  - The output of the `sed` command is then piped into `grep` to retrieve just the `<a` tag lines.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    cat file | sed -e 's/>/>\
    /g' | grep '<a'
    ```

  - Or just lines with double quotes. The single quotes in the following code block tells the shell to take the inner
    characters literally and not do any shell expansion on them. The rest is a regular expression to match a double
    quote followed by any character (`.`) any number of times (`*`), followed by another double quote. This won't work
    if the string itself is split across lines.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    cat file | sed -e 's/>/>\
    /g' | grep '".*"'
    ```

  - By preceding the `read` command with `IFS='"'`, we set that environment variable just for the `read` command, not
    for the entire script. Thus, it will parse with the quotes as its identifier of what separates the words of the
    input lines.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    cat $1 | sed -e 's/>/>\
    /g' | grep '<a' | while IFS='"' read a b c ; do echo $b; done
    ```

#### 1.2.15.4. Parsing Output into an Array

- The following code block illustrates how to use an array to store the output of a program or script as words.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # cookbook filename: parseViaArray
  #
  # find the file size
  # use an array to parse the ls -l output into words

  LSL=$(ls -ld $1)

  declare -a MYRA
  MYRA=($LSL)

  echo the file $1 is ${MYRA[4]} bytes.
  ```

- Each array element can be referred to by each word.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Arrays are easy to initialise if you know the values as you write the script.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  declare -a MYRA
  MYRA=(first second third home)
  ```

- As shown in the script in this section, arrays can also be initialised containing a variable inside parentheses.
  Ensure not to use quotes around the variable. Writing `MYRA=$("$LSL")` will put the entire string into the first
  argument, since it is all contained as one quoted string.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If your want to know how many elements are in the initialised array, reference the variable `${#MYRA[*]}` or
  `${#MYRA[@]}`, either of which is a lot of special characters to type.

#### 1.2.15.5. Parsing Output with a Function Call

- If you want to parse the output of some program into various variables to be used elsewhere in your program, arrays
  are great when you are looping through the values, but not very readable if you want to refer to each separately,
  rather than by an index.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Use a function call to parse the words.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # cookbook filename: parseViaFunc
  #
  # parse ls -l via function call
  # an example of output from ls -l follows:
  # -rw-r--r-- 1 albing users 126 Jun 10 22:50 fnsize

  function ls_parts () {
    PERMS=$1
    LCOUNT=$2
    OWNER=$3
    GROUP=$4
    SIZE=$5
    CR_MONTH=$6
    CR_DAY=$7
    CRTIME=$8
    FILE=$9
  }

  ls_parts $(ls -l "$1")

  echo "$FILE has $LCOUNT link(s) and is $SIZE bytes long."
  ```

- Here's what it looks like when executing the script in the previous code block.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ ./fnsize fnsize
  fnsize has 1 link(s) and is 311 bytes long.

  $
  ```

- Calling a function in a shell script is much calling a separate script. `bash` parses the words into separate
  variables and assigns them to `$1`, `$2`, etc. Our function can just assign each positional parameter to a separate
  variable. If the variables are not declared locally, then they also available inside the function.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.15.6. Parsing Text with a `read` Statement

- Use the `read` command if you don't want to use a function.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `read` separates the input into words (where words are separated by white-space) and assign each word to the
  variables named in the `read` statement. You can even change the separator by setting the `bash` `$IFS` (internal
  field separator) variable, just ensure to set it back to its default.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The output of the following script shows that as `FILE` is the last word, any extra fields will also be part of that
  variable. That way, if the last variable has white-space, then all words in that script will be assigned to `$FILE`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # cookbook filename: parseViaRead
  #
  # Parse ls -l with a read statement

  # An example of output from ls -l follows:
  # -rw-r--r-- 1 owner group 126 2006-10-10 22:50 fnsize

  ls -l "$1" | { read PERMS LCOUNT OWNER GROUP SIZE CRDATE CRTIME FILE ;
  echo $FILE has $LCOUNT 'link(s)' and is $SIZE bytes long. ;
  }
  ```

#### 1.2.15.7. Parsing with `read` into an Array

- Using the `-a`- option on the `read` command means each word will be read into an array variable. `read` will parse
  the input into words, putting into word in its own array element. The variable does not need to be declared as an
  array - assigning it in this fashion is enough to make it it into an array. Each element can be referenced with the
  `bash` array syntax. The number of words will determine the size of the array.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.15.8. Reading an Entire File

- Use the `mapfile` or `readarray` commands in `bash` to read in a whole file and parse it. They are identical commands
  that take the same arguments and let you read an entire file into an array, one entry for each line of the file with
  one statement.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.15.9. Getting Your Plurals Right

- If you want to use a plural noun when you have more than one of an object, but you don't want to scatter `if`
  statements throughout your code, you can use a function similar to the following script.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # cookbook filename: pluralise
  #
  # A function to make words plural by adding an s
  # when the value ($2) is != 1 or -1.
  # It only adds an 's'; it is not very smart.
  #

  function plural () {
    if [ $2 -eq 1 -o $2 -eq -1 ]
    then
    echo ${1}
    else
    echo ${1}s
    fi
  }

  while read num name
  do
    echo $num $(plural "$name" $num)
  done
  ```

- The following shows the execution of the script from the previous code block.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ cat input.file
  1 hen
  2 duck
  3 squawking goose
  4 limerick oyster
  5 corpulent porpoise

  $ ./pluralize < input.file
  1 hen
  2 ducks
  3 squawking gooses
  4 limerick oysters
  5 corpulent porpoises
  ```

- The `if` statement could be rewritten as the following: `if (( $2 == 1 || $2 == -1 ))`. The square bracket with the
  `if` statement is the older form, and is more common across the various versions of `bash`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.15.10. Taking It One Character at a Time

- If you have a string and you need to parse a string one character at a time, a substring function can be used to
  split a string into characters, and tells you the length of a string.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # cookbook filename: one_by_one
  #
  # parsing input one character at a time

  while read ALINE
  do
    for ((i=0; i < ${#ALINE}; i++))
    do
      A_CHARACTER=${ALINE:i:1}
      # do something here, e.g. echo $A_CHARACTER
      echo $A_CHARACTER
    done
  done
  ```

  - The `read` statement will take input from the standard input and place it, one line at a time, into the variable
    `$ALINE`. Since there are no other variables in the `read` statement, it takes the entire line and removes leading
    and trailing `$IFS` whitespace, unless you use `IFS = read`.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The `for` loop will iterate once for each character in the `$ALINE` variable. The amount of times to compute in the
    `for` loop can be identified with `${#ALINE}`, which returns the length of the contents of `$ALINE`.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `$A_CHARACTER` is assigned at each iteration through the loop, from the value of the one-character substring of
    `$ALINE`, that begins at the `i`th position.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.15.11. Cleaning Up an SVN Source Tree

- Subversion's `svn status` command shows all the files that have been modified, but if there are any auto-generated
  files in the source tree, `svn` will also list those files.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You can `grep` output from the `svn status` command and `read` that to create a list of files to delete from the
  source tree.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  svn status src | grep '^\?' | \
    while read status filename; do echo "$filename"; rm -rf "$filename"; done
  ```

- The `svn status` lists one file per line. It puts an `M` as the first character of a line for files that have been,
  modified, an `A` for newly added (but not yet committed) files, and a `?` for those which it knows nothing.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Use `grep` for those lines beginning with a question mark. Process the output in a `while` loop with a `read`
  statement. The `echo` isn't necessary, but it's useful to see what's being removed, just in case there is a mistake
  or an error.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- When removing the file, use the `-rf` options in case the file is a directory. Problems encountered with permissions
  and such are squelched by the `-f` option; it removes the to the level of privilege allowed by your permissions.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.15.12. Setting Up a Database with MySQL

- If you want to create and initialise several databases using MySQL, they should be initialised using the same SQL
  commands. Each database needs its own name, but each database will have the same contents, at least at
  initialisation. You may need to regularly perform this setup, possibly as part of a test suite.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # cookbook filename: db_initialiser
  #
  # initialise databases from a standard file
  # creating databases as needed

  # The `tail -n +2` in the following line is added to remove the heading from the list of databases.
  DB_LIST=$(mysql -e "SHOW DATABASES;" | tail -n +2)

  # The `select` in the following line creates the menus showing the existing databases. The literal `"new..."` is
  # added as an extra choice for the `select` command.
  select DB in $DB_LIST "new..."
  do
    if [[ $DB == "new..." ]]
    then
      printf "%b" "name for new db: "
      read DB rest
      echo creating new database $DB
      mysql -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS $DB;"
    fi

    if [ -n "$DB" ]
    then
      echo Initialising database: $DB
      mysql $DB < ourInit.sql
    fi
  done
  ```

- When the user wants to create a new database, in the code example, we prompt for and parse a new name, but two
  fields are used in the `read` statement to act as error handling. If the user types more than one name on the line,
  we only assign the first value to the variable `$DB`, while the rest of the input is assigned to `$rest` and ignored.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If the `$DB` variable is not empty, it will invoke `mysql` one more time to execute the set of SQL statements that
  we've saved in a file named `outInit.sql`, as our standard initialisation sequence.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You may need to add username and password parameters or prompts to the `mysql` commands if you plan to use the script
  in this section.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Error checking could be added after the creation of the new database to confirm if it succeeded. If it did not
  succeed, `DB` could be unset, thereby bypassing the initialisation.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.15.13. Isolating Specific Fields in Data

- When you need to extract one or more fields from each line of output, use `cut` if there are delimiters you can
  easily pick out, even if they different for the beginning and end of the file you need.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Here's an easy one - what users, home directories and shells do
  # we have on this NetBSD system?
  $ cut --delimiter=':' --fields=1,6,7 /etc/passwd
  root:/root:/bin/csh
  toor:/root:/bin/sh
  daemon:/:/sbin/nologin
  operator:/usr/guest/operator:/sbin/nologin
  bin:/:/sbin/nologin
  games:/usr/games:/sbin/nologin
  postfix:/var/spool/postfix:/sbin/nologin
  named:/var/chroot/named:/sbin/nologin
  ntpd:/var/chroot/ntpd:/sbin/nologin
  sshd:/var/chroot/sshd:/sbin/nologin
  smmsp:/nonexistent:/sbin/nologin
  uucp:/var/spool/uucppublic:/usr/libexec/uucp/uucico
  nobody:/nonexistent:/sbin/nologin
  jp:/home/jp:/usr/pkg/bin/bash
  # What is the most popular shell on the system?
  $ cut -d':' -f7 /etc/passwd | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
  10 /sbin/nologin
  2 /usr/pkg/bin/bash
  1 /bin/csh
  1 /bin/sh
  1 /usr/libexec/uucp/uucico

  # Now let's see the first two directory levels
  $ cut --delimiter=':' --fields=6 /etc/passwd | cut --delimiter='/' -f1-3 | sort --unique
  /
  /home/jp
  /nonexistent
  /root
  /usr/games
  /usr/guest
  /var/chroot
  /var/spool
  ```

- Use `awk` to split on multiples of whitespace, of if you need to rearrange the order of the output fields. Note the
  → denotes a tab character in the output. The default is a space, but you can change that using `$OFS`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Users, home directories, and shells, but swap the last two
  # and use a tab delimiter
  $ awk 'BEGIN {FS=":"; OFS="\t"; } { print $1,$7,$6; }' /etc/passwd
  root → /bin/csh → /root
  toor → /bin/sh → /root
  daemon → /sbin/nologin → /
  operator → /sbin/nologin → /usr/guest/operator
  bin → /sbin/nologin → /
  games → /sbin/nologin → /usr/games
  postfix → /sbin/nologin → /var/spool/postfix
  named → /sbin/nologin → /var/chroot/named
  ntpd → /sbin/nologin → /var/chroot/ntpd
  sshd → /sbin/nologin → /var/chroot/sshd
  smmsp → /sbin/nologin → /nonexistent
  uucp → /usr/libexec/uucp/uucico → /var/spool/uucppublic
  nobody → /sbin/nologin → /nonexistent
  jp → /usr/pkg/bin/bash → /home/jp

  # Multiples of whitespace and swapped, first field removed
  $ grep '^# [1-9]' /etc/hosts | awk '{print $3,$2}'
  10.255.255.255 10.0.0.0
  172.31.255.255 172.16.0.0
  192.168.255.255 192.168.0.0
  ```

- Use `grep --only-matching` to display just the part that matched your pattern. `egrep` is used in the following
  example because of the regular expression, but `--only-matching` should work with whichever GNU `grep` flavour you
  use.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ egrep --only-matching '[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}' /etc/hosts
  10.10.10.10
  10.10.10.11
  10.10.10.12
  10.10.10.13
  ```

- The regex used for IP addresses is naïve and could match other things, including invalid addresses. For a much
  better pattern, use Perl.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Using grep
  $ grep --only-matching --perl-regexp '([01]?\d\d?|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])\.([01]?\d\d?|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])\.
    ([01]?\d\
    d?|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])\.([01]?\d\d?|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])' /etc/hosts
  10.10.10.10
  10.10.10.11
  10.10.10.12
  10.10.10.13

  # Using Perl
  $ perl -n -e 'while ( m/([01]?\d\d?|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])\.([01]?\d\d?|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])\.
    ([01]?\d\d?|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])\.([01]?\d\d?|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])/g ) { print qq($1.$2.$3.$4\n); }' /etc/hosts
  10.10.10.10
  10.10.10.11
  10.10.10.12
  10.10.10.13
  ```

#### 1.2.15.14. Updating Specific Fields in Data Files

- There are multiple options for extracting cert parts (fields) of a line (record) and updating them.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- In a simple case, you can extract a single field from a line, then perform the desired operation on it. You can use
  `awk` or `cut` for that requirement.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- In a more complicated case, you would need to modify a field in a datafile without extracting it. For a simple search
  and replace, use `sed`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- For example, switching everyone from `csh` to `sh` on a NetBSD system.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ grep csh /etc/passwd
  root:*:0:0:Charlie &:/root:/bin/csh

  $ sed 's;/csh$;/sh;' /etc/passwd | grep '^root'
  root:*:0:0:Charlie &:/root:/bin/sh
  ```

- You can use `awk` if your need to perform arithmetic on a field or modify a string only in a certain field.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ cat data_file
  Line 1 ends
  Line 2 ends
  Line 3 ends
  Line 4 ends
  Line 5 ends

  $ awk '{print $1, $2+5, $3}' data_file
  Line 6 ends
  Line 7 ends
  Line 8 ends
  Line 9 ends
  Line 10 ends

  # If the second field contains '3', change it to '8' and mark it
  $ awk '{ if ($2 == "3") print $1, $2+5, $3, "Tweaked" ; else print $0; }' \
  data_file
  Line 1 ends
  Line 2 ends
  Line 8 ends Tweaked
  Line 4 ends
  Line 5 ends
  ```

- There are many possibilities for how to update specific fields in data.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.15.15. Trimming Whitespace

- There are a few possibilities for how to trim leading and/or trailing whitespace from lines for fields of data.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The following solutions rely on a `bash`-specific treatment of `read` and `$REPLY`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - First, we'll show a file with some leading and trailing whitespace. `~~` is added to show the whitespace, and the
    `→` denotes a literal tab character in the output.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    # Show the whitespace in our sample file
    $ while read; do echo ~~"$REPLY"~~; done < whitespace
    ~~ This line has leading spaces.~~
    ~~This line has trailing spaces. ~~
    ~~ This line has both leading and trailing spaces. ~~
    ~~ → Leading tab.~~
    ~~Trailing tab. → ~~
    ~~ → Leading and trailing tab. → ~~
    ~~ → Leading mixed whitespace.~~
    ~~Trailing mixed whitespace. → ~~
    ~~ → Leading and trailing mixed whitespace. → ~~

    $
    ```

  - To trim both leading and trailing whitespace, use `$IFS` and the builtin `$REPLY` variable. The builtin `$REPLY`
    variable that `read` uses when you do not supply your own variable name(s).
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    $ while read REPLY; do echo ~~"$REPLY"~~; done < whitespace
    ~~This line has leading spaces.~~
    ~~This line has trailing spaces.~~
    ~~This line has both leading and trailing spaces.~~
    ~~Leading tab.~~
    ~~Trailing tab.~~
    ~~Leading and trailing tab.~~
    ~~Leading mixed whitespace.~~
    ~~Trailing mixed whitespace.~~
    ~~Leading and trailing mixed whitespace.~~

    $
    ```

  - Trim trim only leading or only trailing *spaces*, use a simple pattern match. When one more more variable names are
    passed to `read`, it does parse the input, using the values in `$IFS` (which are space, tab, and new line by
    default).
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    # Leading spaces only
    $ while read; do echo "~~${REPLY## }~~"; done < whitespace
    ~~This line has leading spaces.~~
    ~~This line has trailing spaces. ~~
    ~~This line has both leading and trailing spaces. ~~
    ~~ → Leading tab.~~
    ~~Trailing tab. ~~
    ~~ → Leading and trailing tab. → ~~
    ~~ → Leading mixed whitespace.~~
    ~~Trailing mixed whitespace. → ~~
    ~~ → Leading and trailing mixed whitespace. → ~~

    # Trailing spaces only
    $ while read; do echo "~~${REPLY%% }~~"; done < whitespace
    ~~ This line has leading spaces.~~
    ~~This line has trailing spaces.~~
    ~~ This line has both leading and trailing spaces.~~
    ~~ → Leading tab.~~
    ~~Trailing tab. ~~
    ~~ → Leading and trailing tab. → ~~
    ~~ → Leading mixed whitespace.~~
    ~~Trailing mixed whitespace. → ~~
    ~~ → Leading and trailing mixed whitespace. → ~~
    ```

  - Trimming only leading or only trailing *whitespace* (including tabs) is more complicated than the previous
    solutions.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    # You need this either way
    $ shopt -s extglob

    # Leading whitespace only
    $ while read; do echo "~~${REPLY##+([[:space:]])}~~"; done < whitespace
    ~~This line has leading spaces.~~
    ~~This line has trailing spaces. ~~
    ~~This line has both leading and trailing spaces. ~~
    ~~Leading tab.~~
    ~~Trailing tab. ~~
    ~~Leading and trailing tab. → ~~
    ~~Leading mixed whitespace.~~
    ~~Trailing mixed whitespace. → ~~
    ~~Leading and trailing mixed whitespace. → ~~

    $

    # Trailing whitespace only
    $ while read; do echo "~~${REPLY%%+([[:space:]])}~~"; done < whitespace
    ~~ This line has leading spaces.~~
    ~~This line has trailing spaces.~~
    ~~ This line has both leading and trailing spaces.~~
    ~~ → Leading tab.~~
    ~~Trailing tab.~~
    ~~ → Leading and trailing tab.~~
    ~~ → Leading mixed whitespace.~~
    ~~Trailing mixed whitespace.~~
    ~~ → Leading and trailing mixed whitespace.~~
    ```

- Trimming leading or trailing spaces (but not both) is easy using the `${##}` or `${%%}` operators.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  while read; do echo "~~${REPLY## }~~"; done < whitespace
  while read; do echo "~~${REPLY%% }~~"; done < whitespace
  ```

- Removing trailing or leading tabs is more difficult than spaces. If there are only tabs, you could use `${##}` or
  `${%%}` operators and insert literal tabs using the `<Ctrl> + v`, `<CTRL> + i` key sequence. That can be risky if
  there's a mix of spaces and tabs. To resolve that, turn on extended globbing and use a character class to make the
  intent more clear. The `[:space:]` character class would work without `extglob`, but `+()` is needed to specify "one
  or more occurrences", or else it would trim single spaces or tabs, but not multiples of both on the same line. You
  could also use the `[:blank:]` character class instead if you only care about spaces or tabs, since `[:space:]`
  includes other characters like the vertical tab `\v` and DOS CR (carriage return) `\r`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # This works, need extglob for +() part
  $ shopt -s extglob
  ...
  $ while read; do echo "~~${REPLY##+([[:space:]])}~~"; done < whitespace
  ...
  $ while read; do echo "~~${REPLY%%+([[:space:]])}~~"; done < whitespace
  ...

  # This doesn't
  $ while read; do echo "~~${REPLY##[[:space:]]}~~"; done < whitespace
  ~~This line has leading spaces.~~
  ~~This line has trailing spaces. ~~
  ~~This line has both leading and trailing spaces. ~~
  ~~Leading tab.~~
  ~~Trailing tab. ~~
  ~~Leading and trailing tab. ~~
  ~~ → Leading mixed whitespace.~~
  ~~Trailing mixed whitespace. → ~~
  ~~ → Leading and trailing mixed whitespace. → ~~
  ```

- The following is another approach, exploiting the same `$IFS` parsing, but to parse out fields (or words) instead of
  records (or lines).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ for i in $(cat white_space); do echo ~~$i~~; done
  ~~This~~
  ~~line~~
  ~~has~~
  ~~leading~~
  ~~white~~
  ~~space.~~
  ~~This~~
  ~~line~~
  ~~has~~
  ~~trailing~~
  ~~white~~
  ~~space.~~
  ~~This~~
  ~~line~~
  ~~has~~
  ~~both~~
  ~~leading~~
  ~~and~~
  ~~trailing~~
  ~~white~~
  ~~space.~~

  $
  ```

- The following is a compiled solution for trimming all leading and trailing whitespace and then show the trimmed text.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  shopt -s extglob

  while IFS= read -r line; do
  echo "None: ~~$line~~" # preserve all whitespaces
  echo "Ld: ~~${line##+([[:space:]])}~~" # trim leading whitespace
  echo "Tr: ~~${line%%+([[:space:]])}~~" # trim trailing whitespace
  line="${line##+([[:space:]])}" # trim leading and...
  line="${line%%+([[:space:]])}" # ...trailing whitespace
  echo "All: ~~$line~~" # Show all trimmed
  done < whitespace
  ```

#### 1.2.15.16. Compressing Whitespace

- If you sections of whitespace in a file (perhaps it is fixed-length, space-padded) and you need to compress the
  spaces down to a single character or delimiter, use `tr` or `awk` as appropriate.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If you are trying to compress sections of whitespace down to a single character, you can use `tr`, but be aware that
  you may damage the structure of the file if it is not well-formed. For example, if fields are delimited by multiple
  whitespace characters, but internally have spaces, compressing multiple spaces down to one will remove that
  distinction.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ cat data_file
  Header1 Header2 Header3
  Rec1_Field1 Rec1_Field2 Rec1_Field3
  Rec2_Field1 Rec2_Field2 Rec2_Field3
  Rec3_Field1 Rec3_Field2 Rec3_Field3

  $ cat data_file | tr -s ' ' '\t'
  Header1 → Header2 → Header3
  Rec1_Field1 → Rec1_Field2 → Rec1_Field3
  Rec2_Field1 → Rec2_Field2 → Rec2_Field3
  Rec3_Field1 → Rec3_Field2 → Rec3_Field3
  ```

- If you field delimiter is more than a single character, `tr` won't work since it translates single characters from
  its first set into the matching single character on the second set. You can use `awk` to combine or convert field
  separators, `awk`'s internal field separate `FS` accepts regular expressions, so you separate on basically any
  character. An assignment to any field causes `awk` to reassemble the record using the output separator, `OFS`, so
  assigning field 1 to itself and then printing the record has the effect of translating `FS` to `OFS` without having
  to worry about the number of records in the data.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- In the following example, multiple spaces delimit fields also have internal spaces, so the following example won't
  work.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ cat data_file1
  Header1 Header2 Header3
  Rec1_Field1 Rec1_Field2 Rec1_Field3
  Rec2_Field1 Rec2_Field2 Rec2_Field3
  Rec3_Field1 Rec3_Field2 Rec3_Field3

  $ awk 'BEGIN {OFS="\t"} {$1=$1; print }' data_file1
  ```

- In the following example, two spaces as assigned to `FS` and the `tab` to OFS. The assignment of `($1 = $1`) is then
  made to ensure `awk` rebuilds the record, but that results in strings of tabs replacing the double quotes, so `gsub`
  is used to squash the tabs, then print the output. There is also a hex dump outputted below, with `09` being the
  ASCII tab value and `20` being the ASCII space value.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ awk 'BEGIN { FS = " "; OFS = "\t" } { $1 = $1; gsub(/\t+ ?/, "\t"); print }' \

  Header1 → Header2 → Header3
  Rec1 Field1 → Rec1 Field2 → Rec1 Field3
  Rec2 Field1 → Rec2 Field2 → Rec2 Field3
  Rec3 Field1 → Rec3 Field2 → Rec3 Field3

  $ awk 'BEGIN { FS = " "; OFS = "\t" } { $1 = $1; gsub(/\t+ ?/, "\t"); print }' \

  ```

- You can use `awk` to trim leading and trailing whitespace in the same way, but as noted previously, this will replace
  your field separators unless they are already spaces.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  awk '{ $1 = $1; print }' white_space
  ```

#### 1.2.15.17. Processing Fixed-Length Records

- If you need to read and process data that is in a fixed-length (also called fixed-width) form, use Perl or `gawk`
  2.13 or greater.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Given the following file, you can process it using GNU's `gawk`, by setting `FIELDWIDTHS` to the correct field
  lengths, settings `OFS` as desired, and making an assignment so that `gawk` rebuilds the record using this `OFS`.
  However, `gawk` does not remove the spaces used in padding the original record, so use two `gsub`s to do that, one for
  all the internal fields and the other for the last field in each record.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ cat fixed-length_file

- If you don't have `gawk`, you can use Perl, which has a simpler solution than the `gawk` solution. The caveat with
  this solution is that new lines should be added to end of each record before processing. The following is done in the
  Perl solution:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - A non-printing `while` input loop is used (`n`).
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Unpack each record `($_)` as it's read.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Turn the resulting list back into a scalar by joining the elements with a tab.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Print each record, adding a new line at the end.

- Fixed-length (a.k.a fixed-width) records are rare in the Unix world, but they are very common in the mainframe world,
  but they will occasionally appear in large applications.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.15.18. Processing Files with No Line Breaks

- If you have a large file with no line breaks, and you need to process it, pre-process the file and add line breaks in
  appropriate places.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- OpenOffice's OpenDocument Format (ODF) files as basically zipped XML files. It is possible to `unzip` them and then
  `grep` the XML.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- In the following example, a new line is inserted after every closing angle bracket (`>`). That makes it much easier
  to process the file using `grep` or other `textutils`. Note that the following must be entered to embed an escaped
  new line in the `sed` script: a backslash (`\`) followed immediately by the `<Enter>` key.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ wc -l content.xml
  1 content.xml

  $ sed -e 's/>/>\
  > /g' content.xml | wc -l

- If you have fixed-length records with no new lines, do the following, where `48` is the length of the record.

#### 1.2.15.19. Converting a Data File to CSV

- If you have a data file that you need to confer to a Comma-Separate Values (CSV) file, use `awk` or Perl to convert
  the data into a CSV format.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `awk` splits up the input fields using a tab as the field separator and set the output field separator (OFS) to
  `","`, which will provide the trailing quote for each field, and then the leading quote for the next field as well as
  the command in between them.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Using `awk`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ awk 'BEGIN { FS="\t"; OFS="\",\"" } { gsub(/"/, "\"\""); $1 = $1; > printf "\"%s\"\n", $0}' tab_delimited
  "Line 1","Field 2","Field 3","Field 4","Field 5 with ""internal"" double-quotes"
  "Line 2","Field 2","Field 3","Field 4","Field 5 with ""internal"" double-quotes"
  "Line 3","Field 2","Field 3","Field 4","Field 5 with ""internal"" double-quotes"
  "Line 4","Field 2","Field 3","Field 4","Field 5 with ""internal"" double-quotes"

  $
  ```

- Using Perl.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ perl -naF'\t' -e 'chomp @F; s/"/""/g for @F; print q(").join(q(","),@F)
  > .qq("\n);' tab_delimited
  "Line 1","Field 2","Field 3","Field 4","Field 5 with ""internal"" double-quotes"
  "Line 2","Field 2","Field 3","Field 4","Field 5 with ""internal"" double-quotes"

  "Line 4","Field 2","Field 3","Field 4","Field 5 with ""internal"" double-quotes"

  $
  ```

- There's no format specification for CSV, making it tricky to define exactly what CSV really means. Various vendors
  have implemented various versions.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.15.20. Parsing a CSV Data File

- If you have a comma-separated values (CSV) data file that you need to parse, unfortunately there is no easy way to do
  this, since it's tricky to define exactly what CST really means.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

### 1.2.16. Writing Secure Shell Scripts

- Any system that depends on concealing implementation details is attempting to use security by obscurity, and that is
  no security at all.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Security by obscurity will never work for long, though some forms of it can be a useful additional layer of security.
  It must never be the only layer of security, because (sooner or later) someone is going to discover whatever you've
  hidden.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Secure shell scripts will reliably do what they are supposed to do, and only what they are supposed to do. They won't
  lead to themselves being exploited to gain root access, they won't accidentally `rm -rf /`, and they won't leak
  information, such as passwords. They will be robust, but will fail gracefully. They will tolerate inadvertent user
  mistakes and sanitise all user input. They will be as simple as possible, and contain only clear, readable code and
  documentation so that the intention of each line in unambiguous.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.16.1. Avoiding Common Security Problems

- When you want to avoid common security problems in your scripting:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Validate all external input, e.g., interactive input, configuration files, interactive use. Never `eval` input
    that you have not checked thoroughly.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Use secure temporary files, ideally in secure temporary directories.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Ensure you are using trusted external executables.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Date validation (or rather the lack of it) is a huge deal in computer security right now. It is a problem that leads
  to buffer overflow and data injection attacks, which are the most common classes of exploit. `bash` doesn't suffer
  from this issue in the same way that C does, but the concepts are the same. In the `bash` world, it's more likely
  that unvalidated input will contain something like `;rm -rf \` than a buffer overflow.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Race conditions are another big issue, closely tied to the problem of an attacker gaining an ability to write over
  unexpected files. A race conditions exists when two or more separate events must occur in the correct order at the
  correct time without external interference. They often result in providing an unprivileged user with read and/or
  write access to files that the user shouldn't be able to access, which can result in privilege escalation, where an
  ordinary user can gain root access. Insecure user of temporary files is a very common factor in this form of attack.
  Using secure temporarily files (especially inside secure temporary directories) will eliminate this attack vector.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Another common attack vector is Trojaned utilities. They appear to be one thing, when they are in fact something
  else. Using a secure `$PATH` is the best way to avoid that from the scripting side. From the system side, there are
  many tools to help you assure system integrity, such as FCheck, Tripwire, and AIDE.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.16.2. Avoiding Interpreter Spoofing

- Pass a single trailing `-` dash to the shell when you want to avoid certain kinds of `setuid root` spoofing attacks.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash -
  ```

- The first line of the script (the *shebang* line) tells the kernel which interpreter to use to process the rest of
  the file. The kernel will also look for a single option to the specified interpreter. There are some attacks that
  take advantage of this fact. This attach can be avoided if you pass an argument to the *shebang*. However,
  hard-coding the path to `bash` may present a portability issue.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.16.3. Setting a Secure `$PATH`

- Set `$PATH` to a known good state at the beginning of every script to ensure you are using a secure path.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Set a sane/secure path
  PATH='/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin'

  # It's almost certainly already marked for export, but make sure
  export PATH
  ```

- Or use the `getconf` utility to get a path guaranteed by POSIX to find all the standard utilities.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  export PATH=$(getconf PATH)
  ```

- Depending on your security risk and needs, you should also consider using absolute paths. This tends to be cumbersome
  and can be an issue where portability is concerns, as different operating systems put tools in different places.
  One way to mitigate these issues (to some extent) is to use variables.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # cookbook filename: finding_tools

  # Export may or may not also be needed, depending on what you are doing

  # These are fairly safe bets
  _cp='/bin/cp'
  _mv='/bin/mv'
  _rm='/bin/rm'

  # These are a little trickier
  case $(/bin/uname) in
    Linux')
      _cut='/bin/cut'
      _nice='/bin/nice'
      # [...]
      ;;
    'SunOS')
      _cut='/usr/bin/cut'
      _nice='/usr/bin/nice'
      # [...]
    ;;
    # [...]
  esac
  ```

- Be careful about the variable names you use. Some programs (like InfoZip) use environment variables such as `$ZIP`
  and `$UNZIP` to pass settings to the program itself.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.16.4. Clearing All Aliases

- Use the `\unalias -a` command to unalias any existing aliases to ensure there are no malicious alias in your
  environment.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If an attacker can trick `root` or even another user into running a command, they will be able to gain access to
  data or privileges they shouldn't have. One way to trick another user into running a malicious program is to create
  an alias to some other common program, e.g., `ls`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The leading `\` is very important, because without it, you can be tricked.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ alias unalias=echo

  $ alias builtin=ls

  $ builtin unalias vi
  ls: unalias: No such file or directory
  ls: vi: No such file or directory

  $ unalias -a
  -a
  ```

- Since the shell finds shell functions before builtins in command search (and allows functions to be exported in the
  environment), it might be worth stressing to use `builtin` before every builtin command. Use `command` to skip
  function lookup, or just `unset` every function you might be interested in using.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.16.5. Clearing the Command Hash

- If you need to ensure your command hash has not been subverted, use the `hash -r` command to clear entries from the
  command hash.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- On execution of a command, `bash` "remembers" the location of most commands found in the `$PATH` to speed up
  subsequent invocations.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If an attacker can trick *root* or even another user into running a command, they will be able to gain access to data
  or privileges they shouldn't have. One way to trick another user into running a malicious program is to manipulate
  the hash so that the wrong program may be executed without the other user's awareness they are running a corrupted
  program.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.16.6. Preventing Core Dumps

- If you want to program your script from dumping core in the case of an unrecoverable error, since core dumps may
  contain sensitive data from memory (such as passwords), use the `bash` builtin `ulimit` to set the core size limit to
  `0`, typically in your `.bashrc` file.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  ulimit -H -c 0 --
  ```

- Core dumps are intended for debugging and containing an image of the memory used by the process at the time it
  failed. That means the file will contain anything the process had stored in memory, e.g., user-entered passwords.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- This can be set in a system-level file such as `/etc/profile` or `/etc/bashrc` to which users have to write access if
  you don't want them to be able to change it.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.16.7. Setting a Secure `$IFS`

- If you want to ensure your internal field separator environment variable is clean, set it to a known good state at
  the beginning of every script using the following syntax. Note that it is not POSIX-compliant.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Set a sane/secure IFS (note this is bash & ksh93 syntax only--not portable!)
  IFS=$' \t\n'
  ```

- As noted in the code block, the syntax is not portable. However, the canonical portable syntax is unreliable because
  it may easily be inadvertently stripped by editors that trim whitespace. The values are traditionally space, tab, new
  line - the order is important. All of the following use the first value of `$IFS` as their separator: `$*` (which
  returns all positional parameters), the special `${!prefix@}` and `${!prefix*}`, and programmable completion.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The typical method for writing leaves a trailing space and tab on the first line.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  IFS=' • → ¶
  '
  ```

- New line, space, then tab is less likely to be trimmed, but that changes the default order, and may result in
  unexpected results from some commands.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  IFS=' ¶
  • → '
  ```

#### 1.2.16.8. Setting a Secure `umask`

- If you want to ensure you are using a secure `umask`, use the `bash` builtin `umask` to set a known good state at the
  beginning of every script.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Set the `$UMASK` variable in case you need to use different masks elsewhere in the program. You could just as easily
  skip it and do the following.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Run a new shell so you don't affect your current
  # environment
  /tmp$ bash

  # Check the current settings
  /tmp$ touch um_current

  # Check some other settings
  /tmp$ umask 000 ; touch um_000
  /tmp$ umask 022 ; touch um_022
  /tmp$ umask 077 ; touch um_077

  /tmp$ ls -l um_*
  -rw-rw-rw- 1 jp jp 0 Jul 22 06:05 um000
  -rw-r--r-- 1 jp jp 0 Jul 22 06:05 um022
  -rw------- 1 jp jp 0 Jul 22 06:05 um077
  -rw-rw-r-- 1 jp jp 0 Jul 22 06:05 umcurrent

  # Clean up and exit the subshell
  /tmp$ rm um_*
  /tmp$ exit
  ```

- `umask` is a mask that specifies the bits to be *taken away* from the default permissions of *777* for directories
  and *666* for files.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.16.9. Finding World-Writeable Directories in Your `$PATH`

- If you want to ensure there are no world-writeable directories in `root`'s `$PATH`, use the following script to check
  your `$PATH`. Use it in conjunction with `su` or `sudo` to check paths for other users.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash

  # cookbook filename: chkpath.1
  # Check your $PATH for world-writeable or missing directories

  exit_code=0

  for dir in ${PATH//:/ }; do
    [ -L "$dir" ] && printf "%b" "symlink, "

    if [ ! -d "$dir" ]; then
      printf "%b" "missing\t\t"
      (( exit_code++ ))
    elif [ -n "$(ls -lLd $dir | grep '^d.......w. ')" ]; then
      printf "%b" "world writeable\t"
      (( exit_code++ ))
    else
      printf "%b" "ok\t\t"
    fi

    printf "%b" "$dir\n"
  done

  exit $exit_code
  ```

- The following is an example of executing the script in this section.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # ./chkpath
  ok /usr/local/sbin
  ok /usr/local/bin
  ok /sbin
  ok /bin
  ok /usr/sbin
  ok /usr/bin
  ok /usr/X11R6/bin
  ok /root/bin
  missing /does_not_exist
  world writeable /tmp
  symlink, world writeable /tmp/bin
  symlink, ok /root/sbin
  #
  ```

- The scripts converts the `$PATH` to a space-delimited list using the technique from, test for symbolic links (`-L`),
  and ensure the directory actually exists (`-d`). Then the script gets a long directory listing (`-l`), dereferencing
  symbolic links (`-L`) and listing the directory name only (`-d`), not the directory's contents. The script then
  finally get to `grep` for world-writeable directories.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The `ok` directories are spaced output, but directories with a problem can get a little cluttered.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The script also provides an exit code of zero on success with no problems detected in the `$PATH`, or the count of
  errors found.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The script can also be updated with the file's mode, owner, and group being added to the output. This information
  could be more valuable than the initial output.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash

  # cookbook filename: chkpath.2
  # Check your $PATH for world-writeable or missing directories, with 'stat'

  exit_code=0

  for dir in ${PATH//:/ }; do
    [ -L "$dir" ] && printf "%b" "symlink, "

    if [ ! -d "$dir" ]; then
      printf "%b" "missing\t\t\t\t"
    (( exit_code++ ))
    else
      stat=$(ls -lHd $dir | awk '{print $1, $3, $4}')

      if [ -n "$(echo $stat | grep '^d.......w. ')" ]; then
        printf "%b" "world writeable\t$stat "
        (( exit_code++ ))
      else
        printf "%b" "ok\t\t$stat "
      fi
    fi

    printf "%b" "$dir\n"
  done

  exit $exit_code
  ```

- The following is an example of executing the updated script in this section.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # ./chkpath ; echo $?
  ok drwxr-xr-x root root /usr/local/sbin
  ok drwxr-xr-x root root /usr/local/bin
  ok drwxr-xr-x root root /sbin
  ok drwxr-xr-x root root /bin

#### 1.2.16.10. Adding the Current Directory to the `$PATH`

- If you are find typing `./<script>` is tedious, and you'd rather just add `.` (or an empty directory, meaning a
  leading or trailing `:` or a `::` in the middle) to your `$PATH`, it is strongly recommended against doing that for
  `root`. However, if you must do that, ensure the `.` comes last and never run the script as `root`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The shell searches the directories listed in `$PATH` when you enter a command name without a path. The reason not to
  add `.` is the same reason not to allow world-writeable directories in your `$PATH`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- For example, if you are in `/tmp` and have `.` as the first thing in your `$PATH`. If you type `ls` and there happens
  to be a file called `/tmp/ls`, you will run that file instead of the `/bin/ls` you intended to run. If you add `.`
  as the last thing in your `$PATH`, you could also run into the same issue.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The easiest solution to this is to not `.` anywhere in the `$PATH`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.16.11. Using Secure Temporary Files

- If you need to create a temporary file or directory, but are aware of the security implications of using a
  predictable name, try using `echo "~$TMPDIR~"` to see if your system provides a secure temporary directory. "~" is
  used as brackets so an output is provided if no value is assigned to the provided variable.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The easy, portable, and "usually good enough" solution is to use the "$RANDOM" inline in your script, like in the
  following example.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Make sure $TMP is set to something
  [ -n "$TMP" ] || TMP='/tmp'

  # Make a "good enough" random temp directory
  until [ -n "$temp_dir" -a ! -d "$temp_dir" ]; do
    temp_dir="/$TMP/meaningful_prefix.${RANDOM}${RANDOM}${RANDOM}"
  done

  mkdir -p -m 0700 $temp_dir
    || { echo "FATAL: Failed to create temp dir '$temp_dir': $?"; exit 100 }
    # Make a "good enough" random temp file
    until [ -n "$temp_file" -a ! -e "$temp_file" ]; do
      temp_file="/$TMP/meaningful_prefix.${RANDOM}${RANDOM}${RANDOM}"
  done

  touch $temp_file && chmod 0600 $temp_file
    || { echo "FATAL: Failed to create temp file '$temp_file': $?"; exit 101 }
  ```

- A better solution is to use both a random temporary directory and a random file name, like in the following example.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # cookbook filename: make_temp

  # Make sure $TMP is set to something
  [ -n "$TMP" ] || TMP='/tmp'

  # Make a "good enough" random temp directory
  until [ -n "$temp_dir" -a ! -d "$temp_dir" ]; do
    temp_dir="/$TMP/meaningful_prefix.${RANDOM}${RANDOM}${RANDOM}"
  do
  e
  mkdir -p -m 0700 $temp_dir \
    || { echo "FATAL: Failed to create temp dir '$temp_dir': $?"; exit 100; }

  # Make a "good enough" random temp file in the temp dir
  temp_file="$temp_dir/meaningful_prefix.${RANDOM}${RANDOM}${RANDOM}"
  touch $temp_file && chmod 0600 $temp_file \
    || { echo "FATAL: Failed to create temp file '$temp_file': $?"; exit 101; }
  ```

- No matter what solution you choose, don't forget to set a "trap" to clean up. As noted previously, `$temp_dir` must
  be set before this "trap" is declared. If those things aren't true, rewrite the logic to account for your needs.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # cookbook filename: clean_temp

  # Do our best to clean up temp files no matter what

  # Note $temp_dir must be set before this, and must not change!
  cleanup="rm -rf $temp_dir"
  trap "$cleanup" ABRT EXIT HUP INT QUIT
  ```

- `$RANDOM` is not available in `dash`, which is `/bin/sh` in some Linux distributions. Current versions of Debian and
  Ubuntu use `dash` because it is smaller and faster than `bash`, thus helping with faster boot faster. That means that
  `/bin/sh` (which used to be a symlink to `bash`) is not a symlink to `dash` instead, and various `bash`-specific
  features will not work.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.16.12. Validating Input

- When you've asked for input (e.g., from a user or a program), and to ensure security or data integrity, you need to
  ensure the correct data has been provided.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- There are various ways to validate your input, depending on what the input is and how strict you need to be. In order
  to validate your input, use pattern matching for simple "it matches or it doesn't" situations.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # cookbook filename: validate_using_case
  case $raw_input in
    *.company.com ) # Probably a local hostname
      ;;
    *.jpg ) # Probably a JPEG file
      ;;
    *.[jJ][pP][gG] ) # Probably a JPEG file, case-insensitive
      ;;
    foo | bar ) # Entered 'foo' or 'bar
      ;;
    [0-9][0-9][0-9] ) # A 3-digit number
      ;;
    [a-z][a-z][a-z][a-z] ) # A 4-lowercase-char word
      ;;
    * ) # None of the above
      ;;
  esac
  ```

- Use a regular expression when pattern matching isn't specific enough and you have `bash` version 3.0+.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.16.13. Setting Permissions

- If you need to set exact permissions for security reasons (or sure you are that you don't care what is already there,
  and you just need to change it), use `chmod` with four-digit octal modes.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  chmod 0755 <some_script>
  ```

- If you only want to add or remove permissions, but need to lave other existing permissions unchanged, use the `+` and
  `-` operations in symbolic mode, respectively.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  chmod +x <some_script>
  ```

- If you try to recursively set permissions on all the files in a directory structure, then you'll have rendered any
  sub-directories non-executable, which means won't be able to access their content, or traverse below them.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  chmod -R 0644 some_directory
  ```

- Use `find` and `xargs` with `chmod` to set the files and directories individually.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # For file permissions.
  find some_directory -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 0644

  # For directory permissions.
  find some_directory -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 0755
  ```

- When creating a directory, use `mkdir -m <mode> <new_directory>` since you not only accomplish two tasks with one
  command, but you avoid any possible race condition between creating the directory and setting the permissions.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- While it is possible to use three-digit octal modes, it is best to use four-digit octal modes to be explicit about
  what we mean to do with all attributes. It is best to use octal mode when possible because it's very clear what
  permissions you are going to end up with.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Before you adjust the permissions on a large group of files, thoroughly test your command, you may also want to back
  up the permissions and owners of the files.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.16.14. Leaking Passwords into the Process List

- `ps` may show passwords entered in plain-text on the command line.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Don't use passwords on the command line.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Many applications that provide a `-p` or similar switch will also prompt you if a password is required and you do not
  provide it on the command line. That's great for interactive us, but not in scripts. If the command can accept the
  password on STDIN, you may be able to pass it in that way. That creates other problems, but it at least avoids
  displaying the password in the process list.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  ./bad_app < ~/.hidden/bad_apps_password
  ```

#### 1.2.16.15. Writing `setuid` or `setgid` Scripts

- You may have a problem that you think you can solve by using the `setuid` or `setgid` bit on a shell script.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Using Unix groups and file permissions and/or `sudo` to grant the appropriate users the least privileges they need to
  accomplish their tasks.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Using the `setuid`  or `setgid` bit on a shell script will create more problems (especially security problems) than
  it solves. Some systems (such as Linux) don't even honour the `setuid` bit on shell scripts, so creating `setuid`
  shell scripts creates an unnecessarily portability problem in addition to the security risks.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `setuid root` scripts are especially dangerous. Use `sudo` instead.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `setuid` and `setgid` have a different meaning when applied to directories than they when applied to executable
  files. When one of these is set on a directory, it causes any newly-created files or subdirectories to be owned by
  the directory's owner or group, respectively.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You can check a file to see if it is `setuid` by using `[ -u <file_path> ]` and check to see if it is `setgid` by
  using `[ -g <file_path> ]`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.16.16. Restricting Guest Users

- If you need to allow some guest users on your system and need to restrict what they can do, ensure to avoid using
  shared accounts where possible, since you lose accountability and create logistical headaches when users leaves and
  you need to change the password. Create separate accounts with the least possible permissions necessary to perform
  the necessary actions. Consider using the following:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - A `chroot` jail.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - SSH to allow non-interactive access to commands or resources.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `bash`'s restricted shell.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The restricted shell is designed to put the user into an environment where their ability to move around and write
  files is severely limited. It's typically used for guest accounts. You can make a user's login shell restricted by
  putting `rbash` in the user's `/etc/passwd` entry if this option was included when `bash` was compiled.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The specific constraints imposed by the restricted shell disallow the users from doing the following. These
  restrictions are applied after the user's `.bash_profile` and environment variables are run. It is wise to change the
  owner of the user's `.bash_profile` and `.bash` files to `root`, and make these files read-only. The user's home
  directory should also be made read-only.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Changing working directories. `cd` is inoperative. You will get the following error message if you try to use `cd`:
    `cd:restricted from bash`.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Redirecting output. The redirectors `>`, `>|`, `<>`, and `>>` are not allowed.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Assigning a new value to the environment variables `$END`, `$BASH_ENV`, `$SHELL`, or `$PATH`.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Specifying any command with slashes (`/`) in them. The shell will treat files outside the current directory as "not
    found".
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Using the `exec` builtin.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Specifying a file name containing `/` as an argument to the `.` (`source`) builtin command.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Importing function definitions from the shell environment at startup.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Adding or deleting builtin commands with the `-f` and `-d` options to the `enable` builtin command.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Specifying the `-p` option to the `command` builtin command.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Turning off restricted mode with `set +r`.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The restricted shell user's entire environment is set up in `/etc/profile` and `.bash_profile`. Since the user can't
  access `/etc/profile` and can't overwrite `.bash_profile`, this lets the system administrator configure the
  environment as required. It's also a good idea that the last command in the startup file be `cd` to some other
  directory, usually a subdirectory of the user's `$HOME` for an extra layer or protection.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Two common ways of setting up such environments are to set up a directory of safe commands and have that directory be
  the only one in `$PATH`, and to set up a command menu from which the user can't escape without exiting the shell.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The restricted shell is not a catch-all for security against a determined attacker. It can also be difficult to lock
  down as well as you think you, since many applications (such as `vi` and Emacs) allow shell escapes that might bypass
  the restricted shell entirely. The restricted shell can be a valuably layer of security, but it should not be the
  only layer.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The only original Bourne shell has a restricted version called `rsh`, which may be confused with the so-called
  *r-tools* remote shell program (`rsh`, `rcp`, `rlogin`, etc.), which is also `rsh`. The very insecure `rsh` has been
  mostly replaced by `ssh`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.16.17. Using `chroot` Jails

- If you have to use a script or application that you don't trust, consider placing it in a so-called *chroot jail*.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The `chroot` command changes the root directory of the current process to the directory you specify then returns a
  shell of `execs` a given command. This has the effect of placing the process (and therefore the program) into a fail
  from which it theoretically can't escape to the parent directory. If that application is compromised or otherwise
  does something malicious, it can only affect the small portion of the filesystem you restricted it to. In conjunction
  with running as a user with very limited rights, this is a very useful layer of security to add.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The reason why not everything runs in *chroot jails* is because many applications need to interact with other
  applications, files, directories, or sockets all over the file system. That's the tricky part about using chroot
  jails; the application can't see outside of its walls, so everything it needs must be inside those walls. The more
  complicated the application, the more difficult it is to run in a jail.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.16.18. Running as Non-root User

- If you'd l;ike to run your scripts as a non-root user, but are afraid you won't be able to do the things you need to
  do, run your scripts under your non-root user IDs (either as you or as dedicated users), and run interactively as
  non-root, but configure `sudo` to handle any tasks that require any elevated privileges. `sudo` may be used in a
  script as easily as it may be used interactively.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.16.19. Using `sudo` More Securely

- It is good to be cautious about granting too many people too many privileges, especially with the use of `sudo`.
  While using `sudo` is much more secure than not using it, the default settings may be greatly improved.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You can edit the `/etc/sudoers` file to modify the privileges granted for each user.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- In most cases you should not be using the `ALL=(ALL) ALL` specification. It will work, but it is not remotely secure.
  The only difference between that and giving everyone the `root` password is that they don't know the `root` password;
  they can still do everything `root` can do.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `sudo` logs the commands it runs, but that's trivial to avoid using `sudo bash`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Just as you shouldn't be using the `ALL=(ALL) ALL` specification, you probably shouldn't be managing users one by
  one either. The `sudoers` utility allow for very granular management, and it is best to use it. `man sudoers`
  provides a wealth of material and examples, especially the section on preventing shell escapes.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The `sudoers` file has a `NOPASSWD` tag that allows users to perform privileged operations without first having to
  enter their user passwords. This is one way to allow automation requiring `root` access without having
  unnecessary/redundant plain-text passwords, but it is obviously a double-edged sword.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `sudoers` allows for four kinds of aliases: `user`, `runas`, `host`, and `command`. Judicious use of them as roles
  or groups will significantly reduce the maintenance burden. You can set up a `User_Alias` for `BUILD_USERS`, then
  define the machines those users need to run on with `Host_Alias` and the commands they need to run with `Cmnd_Alias`.
  You can set up a very secure yet usable system of least privilege if you set a policy to only edit `/etc/sudoers` on
  one machine and copy it around to all relevant machines periodically using `scp` with public-key authentication, you
  can set up a very secure yet usable system of least privilege.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- When `sudo` asks for your password, it's really asking for your password, not the `root` password.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If you set a policy to only edit `/etc/sudoers` on one machine and copy it around to all relevant machines
  periodically using `scp` with public-key authentication, you can set up a very secure yet usable of least privilege.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Unfortunately, `sudo` is not installed by default on every system. It is usually installed on Linux, macOS, and
  OpenBSD; other systems will vary.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You should always used `visudo` to edit your `etc/sudoers` file. Like `vipw`, `visudo`, locks the file so that only
  one person can edit at a time, and it performs some syntax sanity checks before replacing the production file,
  meaning you don't accidentally lock yourself out of your system.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.16.20. Using Passwords in Scripts

- It is a bad idea to hard-code a password in a script and so it should be avoided whenever possible. Unfortunately, it
  isn't possible to avoid it.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The first way to try to avoid doing this is to see if you can use `sudo` with the `NOPASSWD` option to avoid having
  to hard-code a password anywhere.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Another alternative may be to use SSH with public keys and ideally restricted commands.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If there is no other way around it, the best option is to put the user ID and password in a separate file that is
  read-only by the user who needs it, then source that file when necessary. Ensure to exclude that file from version
  control.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.16.21. Using SSH Without a Password

- There are two ways to use SSH without a password: the wrong way and the right way.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The wrong way is use a public key that is not encrypted by a passphrase.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The right way it to use a passphrase-protected public key with `ssh-agent` or `keychain`.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    - First, you need to create a key pair if you don't already have one. Only one key pair is necessary to
      authenticate you to as many machines as you configure, but you may decide to use more than one key pair, perhaps
      for a myriad of reasons.
      [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    - Use `ssh-keygen` (this might be `ssh-keygen2` if you're not using OpenSSH) to create a key pair.
      [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    - Once you have a key pair, add your public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file in your home directory on any
      other machines to which you wish to connect using this key pair. You can do this by accessing the remote server
      with commands like `scp` or `ssh`.
      [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- When using SSH in a script, you don't want to be prompted to authenticate or have extraneous warning displayed. The
  `-q` option will turn on quiet mode and suppress warning while `-o BatchMode yes` will prevent user prompts. If there
  is no way for SSH to authenticate itself, it will fail, since it can't even fall back to prompting for a password.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If `keychain` doesn't seem to be working, or if it works for a while then seems to stop, you may have another script
  somewhere else rerunning `ssh-agent` and getting things out of sync.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.16.22. Restricting SSH Commands

- If you'd like to restrict what an incoming SSH user or script can do, edit the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file, use SSH
  forced commands, and optionally disable unnecessary SSH features.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- First, you need to determine exactly what command is being run on the remote side.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Create a key (as outlined in [1.2.16.21. Using SSH Without a Password](#121621-using-ssh-without-a-password)) and
  add a forced command. Edit the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file and add the following before the key.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    command="/bin/echo Command was: $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND"
    ```

  - The key with the preceding contents (from the previous code block) should look like the following.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    command="/bin/echo Command was: $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND" ssh-dss

- Execute your command to see the output.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ ssh remote_host 'ls -l /etc'
  Command was: ls -l /etc

  $
  ```

- The problem with the previous solution is that it will break a program like `rsync` that depends on having the
  STDOUT/STDIN channel all to itself.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ rsync -avzL -e ssh remote_host:/etc .
  protocol version mismatch -- is your shell clean?
  (see the rsync manpage for an explanation)
  rsync error: protocol incompatibility (code 2) at compat.c(64)

  $
  ```

  - That can be resolved by modifying the forced command like the following.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    command="/bin/echo Command was: $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND >> ~/ssh_command"
    ```

  - On the client side, the command can be tried again.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    $ rsync -avzL -e ssh 192.168.99.56:/etc .
    rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [receiver]
    rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at io.c(420)

    $
    ```

  - On the remote host side, the following is the output.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    $ cat ../ssh_command
    Command was: rsync --server --sender -vlLogDtprz . /etc

    $
    ```

- Two other things that can be done are (1) set a from host restriction, and (2) disable SSH commands. The host
  restriction specifies the hostname or IP address of the source host.

  sK0Ncygno/0F1ew== This is my new key
  ```

- If you'd like to be a little more open about what the key can and can't do, look into the OpenSSH restricted shell,
  `rssh`, which supports `scp`, `sftp`, `rdist`, `rsync`, and `cvs`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You'd think restrictions like these would be easy, but it turns out they are not. The problem has to do with the way
  SSH (and the `r`-commands before it) actually works. It's a brilliant idea and it works very well, except that it's
  hard to limit. To vastly over‐simplify it, you can think of SSH as connecting your local `STDOUT` to `STDIN` on the
  remote side and the remote `STDOUT` to your local `STDIN`, so all things like `scp` or `rsync` do is stream bytes
  from the local machine to the remote machine as if over a pipe. But that very flexibility precludes SSH from being
  able to restrict interactive access while allowing `scp`. There's no difference. And that's why you can't put lots of
  `echo` and debugging statements in your bash configuration files that output will intermingle with the byte stream
  and cause havoc.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `rssh` works by providing a wrapper that you use instead of a default login shell (like `bash`) in `/etc/passwd`.
  That wrapper determines what it will and will not allow, but with much more flexibility than a plain old
  SSH-restricted command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

### 1.2.17. Disconnecting Inactive Sessions

- Set the `$TMOUT` environment variable in `/etc/bashrc` or `~/.bashrc` to the number of seconds of inactivity before
  ending a session when you'd like to be able to automatically log out inactive users, especially `root`. In
  interactive mode, once a prompt is issued, if the user does not enter a command in `$TMOUT` seconds, `bash` will
  exit.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `$TMOUT` is also used in the `read` builtin and the `select` command in scripts.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Don't forget to set this as a read-only variable in a system-level file such as `/etc/profile` or `/etc/bashrc` to
  which users have no write access if you don't want them to be able to change it.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  declare -r TMOUT=3600
  # Or:
  readonly TMOUT=3600
  ```

#### 1.2.17.1. Advanced Scripting

- One of the biggest problems for advanced scripts is writing scripts that are portable, i.e., that can work on any
  machine that has `bash` installed.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- There are many variations from one system to another that can get in the way; for example, `bash` itself isn't always
  installed in the same place, and many common Unix commands have slightly different options (or give slightly
  different output) depending on the operating system.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- This chapter will cover solutions for additional advanced scripting tasks, such as automating processes using phases,
  sending email from your script, logging to `syslog`, using your network resources, and a few tricks for getting input
  and redirecting output.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.17.2. Finding `bash` Portable for `#!`

- If you need to run a `bash` script on several machines, but `bash` is not always in the same place, use the
  `/usr/bin/env` command in the shebang line. If your system doesn't have `env` in `/usr/bin`, ask your system
  administrator to install it, move it, or create a symbolic link because this is the required location.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  ```

- `env`'s purpose is to "run a program in a modified environment", but since it will search the path for the command it
  is given to run, it works very well for this use.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Don't use `!/bin/sh` instead of the `#!/usr/bin/env`. If you are using `bash`-specific features in your script, they
  will not work on machines that do not use `bash` in Bourne shell mode for `/bin/sh`. Even if you aren't using
  `bash`-specific features now, you may forget about that in the future.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You may see a space between the `#!` and `/bin/<whatever>`. There were historically some systems that required the
  space, though in practice that will rarely be encountered. It's very unlikely any system running `bash` will require
  the space, and leaving it out it the common usage now. For the utmost historical compatibility, use the space.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Many systems (including Linux) allow only a single argument to the interpreter. Thus, `#!/usr/bin/env bash -` will
  result in the following error: `/usr/bin/env: bash -: No such file or directory`. This is because the interpreter is
  `/usr/bin/env` and the single allowed argument is `bash -` Since the trailing `-` is a common security practice and
  since this is supported on some systems but not others, this is a security and portability problem. Omit the `-` when
  using `env` for portability, and to hard-code the interpreter and trailing, when security is critical.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.17.3. Setting a POSIX `$PATH`

- If you are on a machine that provides older or proprietary tools (e.g., Solaris) and you need to set your path so
  that you get POSIX-compliant tools.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `getconf` reports various system configuration variables, so you can use it to set a default path. However, unless
  `getconf` itself is a builtin, you will need a minimal path to find it, hence the `PATH=/bin:/usr/bin` part of the
  solution.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  PATH=$(PATH=/bin:/usr/bin getconf PATH)
  ```

- The following are some default and POSIX paths on several systems:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4.3
  $ echo $PATH
  /usr/kerberos/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/home/$USER/bin

  $ getconf PATH
  /bin:/usr/bin

  # Debian Sarge
  $ echo $PATH
  /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games

  $ getconf PATH
  /bin:/usr/bin

  # Solaris 10
  $ echo $PATH
  /usr/bin:

  $ getconf PATH
  /usr/xpg4/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/bin:/opt/SUNWspro/bin

  # OpenBSD 3.7
  $ echo $PATH
  /home/$USER/bin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/games

  $ getconf PATH
  /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/bin
  ```

#### 1.2.17.4. Developing Portable Shell Scripts

- When you are writing a shell script that will need to run on multiple versions of multiple Unix or POSIX operating
  systems, try using the `command` builtin with its `-p` option to find the POSIX version of `program`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  command -p program <arguments>
  ```

- If possible, find the oldest or least capable Unix machine you have access to and develop the script on that
  platform. If you aren't sure what is the least capable platform, use a BSD variant of Solaris (and the older the
  version, the better).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `command -p` uses a default path that is guaranteed to find all of the POSIX-standard utilities.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The problems with writing cross-platform shell scripts on Linux are:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `/bin/sh` is not the Bourne shell; it's really `/bin/bash` in POSIX mode, except when it's `/bin/dash` (e.g.,
    Ubuntu 6.10+). None of the three mentioned work exactly the same. In particular, the behaviour of `echo` can
    change.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Linux uses the GNU tools instead of the original Unix tools.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The GNU tools have a lot of switches and features that aren't present on other platforms, and your script will
  unexpectedly break in odd ways.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The more shell features you use, the less you have to depend on external programs that may or may not be there or
  work as expected. While `bash` is far more capable than `sh`, it's also one of the tools that may or may not be
  there.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The GNU long options are also much more readable in shell code, but are often not present on other systems.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If you don't have a non-Linux system, then the issues described in this section are irrelevant.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.17.5. Testing Scripts Using Virtual Machines

- If you need to develop cross-platform scripts but do not have the appropriate systems or hardware, and if the target
  platforms runs on x86 architecture, you can use of the many free and commercial virtualisation solutions and build
  your own test virtual machine, or search for pre-built virtual machines on the OS vendor or distributor's site, or
  the internet. The flaw with this solutions is that some systems don't run on an x86 architecture, and thus don't run
  under x86 virtualisation.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Testing shell scripts is not very resource-intensive, so even moderate hardware capable of running a virtualisation
  package should be fine. Minimal virtual machines with 128 MB of RAM, or sometimes even less, should be more than
  enough for a shell environment for testing. Setting up an NFS (Network File System) share to store your test scripts
  and data, and then SSH to the test system.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.17.6. Using `for` Loops Portably

- There are multiple options of implementing a `for` loop but want it to work on older versions of `bash`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The following method is portable back to `bash` 2.04+.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ for ((i=0; i<10; i++)); do echo $i; done
  0
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9
  ```

- There are nicer ways of writing the `for` loop in newer versions of `bash`, but they are not backwards-compatible.
  As of `bash` 3.0+, the `{x..y}` can be used.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ for i in {1..10}; do echo $i; done
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9
  10
  ```

- The following could be the implementation if your system has the `seq` command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ for i in $(seq 1 10); do echo $i; done
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9
  10
  ```

#### 1.2.17.7. Using `echo` Portably

- If you are writing a script that will run on multiple versions of Unix and Linux and you need `echo` to behave
  consistently even if it is not running on `bash`, use `printf "$b" whatever`, or test for the system and set
  `xpg_echo` using `shopt -s xpg_echo` as needed.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If you omit the `"$b"` format string, then `printf` will try to interpret any `%` characters in `whatever`, which is
  probably not what you want. The `"$b"` format is an addition to the standard `printf` format that will prevent that
  misinterpretation and also expand backslash escape sequences in `whatever`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Setting `spg_echo` is less consistent since it only works on `bash`. It can be effective if you are sure that you'll
  only ever run under `bash`, and not under `sh` or another similar shell that doesn't use `xg_echo`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Using `printf` required changes to how you write `echo` statements, but it's defined by POSIX and should be
  consistent across any POSIX shell anywhere. Specifically, you will have to write `printf "$b"` instead of just
  `echo`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If you automatically type `$b` instead of `%b` you will be unhappy, because that will print a blank line, since you
  have specified a null format. Unless `$b` is actually defined, in which case the results depend on the value of `$b`.
  Either way, this can be a very difficult bug to find since `$b` and `%b` look very similar.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ printf "%b" "Works"
  Works

  $ printf "$b" "Broken"

  $
  ```

- In some shells, the builtin `echo` behaves differently than the external `echo` used on other systems. This is not
  always obvious when running on Linux since `/bin/sh` is actually `bash` (usually; it could also be `dash` on Ubuntu
  6.10+), and there are similar circumstances on some BSDs. The difference is in how `echo` does or does not expand
  backslash-escape sequences. Shell builtin versions tend not to expand, while external versions (e.g., `/bin/echo` and
  `/usr/bin/echo`) tend to expand; but again, that can change from system to system.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Typical Linux (`/bin/bash`).
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    $ type -a echo
    echo is a shell builtin
    echo is /bin/echo

    $ builtin echo "one\ttwo\nthree"
    one\ttwo\nthree\n

    $ /bin/echo "one\ttwo\nthree"
    one\ttwo\nthree\n

    $ echo -e "one\ttwo\nthree"
    one → two
    three

    $ /bin/echo -e "one\ttwo\nthree"
    one → two
    three

    $ shopt -s xpg_echo

    $ builtin echo "one\ttwo\nthree"
    one → two
    three

    $ shopt -u xpg_echo

    $ builtin echo "one\ttwo\nthree"
    one\ttwo\nthree\n
    ```

  - Typical BSD (`/bin/csh`, then `/bin/sh`).
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    $ which echo
    echo: shell builtin command.

    $ echo "one\ttwo\nthree"
    one\ttwo\nthree\n

    $ /bin/echo "one\ttwo\nthree"
    one\ttwo\nthree\n

    $ echo -e "one\ttwo\nthree"
    -e one\ttwo\nthree\n

    $ /bin/echo -e "one\ttwo\nthree"
    -e one\ttwo\nthree\n

    $ printf "%b" "one\ttwo\nthree"
    one → two

    $ /bin/sh

    $ echo "one\ttwo\nthree"
    one\ttwo\nthree\n

    $ echo -e "one\ttwo\nthree"
    one → two
    three

    $ printf "%b" "one\ttwo\nthree"
    one → two
    three
    ```

  - Solaris 10 (`/bin/sh`).
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    $ which echo
    /usr/bin/echo

    $ type echo
    echo is a shell builtin

    $ printf "%b" "one\ttwo\nthree"
    one → two
    three
    ```

#### 1.2.17.8. Splitting Output Only When Necessary

- If you want to only split an output if the input exceeds your limit, but the `split` command always creates at least
  one new file, you can use the following example to break up the input into fixed sizes, only if the input exceeds the
  size limit. Depending on your system, some options (e.g., `-C`) may not available in `split` or `wc`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # cookbook filename: func_split
  # Output fixed-size pieces of input ONLY if the limit is exceeded
  # Called like: Split <file> <prefix> <limit option> <limit argument>
  # e.g. Split $output ${output}_ --lines 100
  # See split(1) and wc(1) for option details
  function Split {
    local file=$1
    local prefix=$2
    local limit_type=$3
    local limit_size=$4
    local wc_option

    # Sanity checks
    if [ -z "$file" ]; then
      printf "%b" "Split: requires a file name!\n"
      return 1
    fi

    if [ -z "$prefix" ]; then
      printf "%b" "Split: requires an output file prefix!\n"
      return 1
    fi

    if [ -z "$limit_type" ]; then
      printf "%b" \
      "Split: requires a limit option (e.g. --lines), see 'man split'!\n"
      return 1
    fi

    if [ -z "$limit_size" ]; then
      printf "%b" "Split: requires a limit size (e.g. 100), see 'man split'!\n"
      return 1
    fi

    # Convert split options to wc options. Sigh.
    # Not all options supported by all wc/splits on all systems
    case $limit_type in
      -b|--bytes) wc_option='-c';;
      -C|--line-bytes) wc_option='-L';;
      -l|--lines) wc_option='-l';;
    esac

    # If whatever limit is exceeded
    if [ "$(wc $wc_option $file | awk '{print $1}')" -gt $limit_size ]; then
      # Actually do something
      split --verbose $limit_type $limit_size $file $prefix
    fi
  } # end of function Split
  ```

#### 1.2.17.9. Viewing Output in Hex

- If you need to see an output in hex mode to verify that a certain whitespace or unprintable character is as expected,
  pipe the output through `hexdump` using the `-C` option for a canonical output.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ hexdump -C filename
  00000000 4c 69 6e 65 20 31 0a 4c 69 6e 65 20 32 0a 0a 4c |Line 1.Line 2..L|
  00000010 69 6e 65 20 34 0a 4c 69 6e 65 20 35 0a 0a |ine 4.Line 5..|
  0000001e

  $
  ```

- For another example, `nl` uses spaces, then the line number, then a tab in its output.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ nl -ba filename | hexdump -C
  00000000 20 20 20 20 20 31 09 4c 69 6e 65 20 31 0a 20 20 | 1.Line 1. |
  00000010 20 20 20 32 09 4c 69 6e 65 20 32 0a 20 20 20 20 | 2.Line 2. |
  00000020 20 33 09 0a 20 20 20 20 20 34 09 4c 69 6e 65 20 | 3.. 4.Line |
  00000030 34 0a 20 20 20 20 20 35 09 4c 69 6e 65 20 35 0a |4. 5.Line 5.|
  00000040 20 20 20 20 20 36 09 0a | 6..|
  00000048

  $
  ```

- `hexdump` is a BSD utility that's also provided with many Linux distributions. Other systems (notable Solaris) do not
  have it by default. You can use the octal dump command `od`, but its output is only one format at a time, and its
  addresses are in octal, not hex.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ nl -ba filename | od -x
  0000000 2020 2020 3120 4c09 6e69 2065 0a31 2020

#### 1.2.17.10. Using `bash` Net-Redirection

- If you need to send or receive very simple network traffic, but you do not have a tool such as Netcat installed, and
  if you have `bash` version 2.04+ compiled with `--enable-net-redirections` (the default), you can use `bash` itself,
  you can use the following commands.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ exec 3<> /dev/tcp/checkip.dyndns.org/80

  $ echo -e "GET / HTTP/1.0\n" >&3

  $ cat <&3
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: text/html
  Server: DynDNS-CheckIP/1.0
  Connection: close
  Cache-Control: no-cache
  Pragma: no-cache
  Content-Length: 105
  <html><head><title>Current IP Check</title></head>
  <body>Current IP Address: 72.NN.NN.225</body></html>

  $ exec 3<> /dev/tcp/checkip.dyndns.org/80

  $ echo -e "GET / HTTP/1.0\n" >&3

  $ egrep --only-matching 'Current IP Address: [0-9.]+' <&3
  Current IP Address: 72.NN.NN.225

  $
  ```

  - Debian and its derivatives such as Ubuntu expressly compiled with `--disable-net-redirections` until `bash` version
    4, so the previous example will not work on those versions.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - It is possible to use `exec` to redirect file handles within the current shell session, so the first command sets
    up input and output on file handle `3`. The second line sends a trivial command to a path on the web server defined
    in the first command. The user agent will appear as `-` on the web server side, causing the "flagged User Agent"
    warning. The third command simply displays the results.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Both TCP and UDP are supported. The following is a trivial way to send `syslog` messages to a remove server, although
  the `logger` utility should be used in production, as it is more user-friendly and robust.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  echo "<133>${0##*/}[$$]: Test syslog message from bash" \
    > /dev/udp/loghost.example.com/514
  ```

  - Since UDP connection, the second example is much easier to use than the first example.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `<133>` is the `syslog` priority value for `local0.notice`.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `$0` is the name, so `${0##*/}` is the "basename".
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `$$` is the process ID of the current program. This will be `-bash` for a login shell.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.17.11. Finding My IP Address

- If you need to know the IP address of the machine you are running on, there is no good way to do this that will work
  on all systems in all situations, so there are several possible solutions.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - You can parse output from `ifconfig` to look for IP addresses. The commands in the following code block will either
    return the first IP address that is not a loopback, or nothing if there are no interfaces configured or up.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    # cookbook filename: finding_ipas

    # IPv4 Using awk, cut, and head
    $ /sbin/ifconfig -a | awk '/(cast)/ { print $2 }' | cut -d':' -f2 | head -1

    # IPv4 Using Perl, just for fun
    $ /sbin/ifconfig -a | perl -ne 'if ( m/^\s*inet (?:addr:)?([\d.]+).*?cast/ )
    > { print qq($1\n); exit 0; }'

    # IPv6 Using awk, cut, and head
    $ /sbin/ifconfig -a | egrep 'inet6 addr: |address: ' | cut -d':' -f2- \
    | cut -d'/' -f1 | head -1 | tr -d ' '

    # IPv6 Using Perl, just for fun
    $ /sbin/ifconfig -a | perl -ne 'if
    > ( m/^\s*(?:inet6)? \s*addr(?:ess)?: ([0-9A-Fa-f:]+)/ ) { print qq($1\n);
    > exit 0; }'
    ```

  - You can get your host name and resolve it back to an IP address. This is often unreliable, because today's systems
    (especially workstations) might have incomplete or incorrect host names and/or might be on a dynamic network that
    lacks proper reverse lookup. Use at your own risk and test thoroughly.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    host $(hostname)
    ```

  - You may be more interested in your host's external, routeable address than its internal RFC 1918 address. In that
    case, you can use an external host, such as <http://whatismyip.akamai.com>, <http://checkip.amazonaws.com/>,
    <http://ipinfo.io/>, or others to learn the address of your firewall or NAT (Network Address Translation) device.
    The caveat here is that non-Linux systems often have no command line tool like `wget` installed by default. `lynx`
    or `curl` will also work, but they usually aren't installed by default either. The IP address and other information
    is deliberately obscured in the following examples.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    $ wget -qO - http://ipinfo.io/
    {
    "ip": "8.8.8.8",
    "hostname": "google-public-dns-a.google.com",
    "city": "Mountain View",
    "region": "California",
    "country": "US",
    "loc": "37.3860,-122.0840",
    "org": "AS15169 Google Inc.",
    "postal": "94035",
    "phone": "650"
    }

    $ wget -qO - http://ipinfo.io/ip/
    72.NN.NN.225

    $ lynx -dump http://ipinfo.io/ip/
    72.NN.NN.225

    $ curl whatismyip.akamai.com
    72.NN.NN.225

    $ curl http://checkip.amazonaws.com
    72.NN.NN.225
    ```

- If you do not have any of the programs used in this section, but you do have `bash` version *2.04+* compiled with
  `--enable-net-redirections` (it isn't compiled this way prior to `bash` 4 in Debian and derivatives), you can use
  `bash` itself.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    $ exec 3<> /dev/tcp/checkip.dyndns.org/80

#### 1.2.17.12. Getting Input from Another Machine

- If your script needs to get input from another machine, perhaps to check if a file exists or a process is running,
  use SSH with public keys and command substitution. To do this, set up SSH so that you do not need a password. Next,
  tailor the command run by SSH to output exactly what you script needs as input. Then, simply use command
  substitution.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash

  # cookbook filename: command_substitution

  REMOTE_HOST='host.example.com' # Required
  REMOTE_FILE='/etc/passwd' # Required
  SSH_USER='user@' # Optional, set to '' to not use
  #SSH_ID='-i ~/.ssh/foo.id' # Optional, set to '' to not use
  SSH_ID=''

  result=$(
    ssh $SSH_ID $SSH_USER$REMOTE_HOST \
      "[ -r $REMOTE_FILE ] && echo 1 || echo 0"
  ) || { echo "SSH command failed!" >&2; exit 1; }

  if [ $result = 1 ]; then
    echo "$REMOTE_FILE present on $REMOTE_HOST"
  else
    echo "$REMOTE_FILE not present on $REMOTE_HOST"
  fi
  ```

#### 1.2.17.13. Redirecting Output for the Life of a Script

- If you'd like to redirect output for an entire script, and you'd rather not have to every `echo` or `printf`
  statement, you can use a little-known feature of the `exec` command to redirect `STDOUT` or `STDERR`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Optional, save the "old" STDERR
  exec 3>&2

  # Redirect any output to STDERR to an error logfile instead
  exec 2> /path/to/error_log

  # Script with "globally" redirected STDERR goes here

  # Turn off redirect by reverting STDERR and closing FH3
  exec 2>&3-
  ```

- Usually `exec` replaces the running shell with the command supplied in its arguments, destroying the original shell.
  However, if no command is given, it can manipulate redirection in the current shell. You are not limited to
  redirecting `STDOUT` or `STDERR`, but they are the most common targets for redirection in this case.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.17.14. Working Around `"Argument list too long"` Errors

- If you get an "argument list too long" error while trying to do an operation involving shell wildcard expansion, use
  the `xargs` command, possibly in conjunction with `find`, to break up your argument list.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- For simple cases, use a `for` loop or `find`, instead of `ls`. This example works correctly with the `echo` command,
  but when you feed that `"$i"` into other programs, especially other constructs, `$IFS` and other parsing may come
  into play.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ ls /path/with/many/many/files/*e*
  -/bin/bash: /bin/ls: Argument list too long

  # Short demo, surrounding ~ are for illustration only
  $ for i in ./some_files/*e*; do echo "~$i~"; done
  ~./some_files/A file with (parens)~
  ~./some_files/A file with [brackets]~
  ~./some_files/File with embedded
  newline~
  ~./some_files/file with = sign~
  ~./some_files/file with spaces~
  ~./some_files/file with |~
  ~./some_files/file with:~
  ~./some_files/file with;~
  ~./some_files/regular_file~

  $ find ./some_files -name '*e*' -exec echo ~{}~ \;
  ~./some_files~
  ~./some_files/A file with [brackets]~
  ~./some_files/A file with (parens)~
  ~./some_files/regular_file~
  ~./some_files/file with spaces~
  ~./some_files/file with = sign~
  ~./some_files/File with embedded
  newline~
  ~./some_files/file with;~
  ~./some_files/file with:~
  ~./some_files/file with |~

  $ for i in /path/with/many/many/files/*e*; do echo "$i"; done
  [This works, but the output is too long to list]

  $ find /path/with/many/many/files/ -name '*e*'
  [This works, but the output is too long to list]
  ```

- Note that the default behaviour of `bash` (and `sh`) is to return unmatched patterns unchanged. That means you could
  end your for loop setting `$i` to `./some_files/*e*` if no files match the wildcard pattern.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You might assume that the `for` loop solution in the simple case would run into the same problem as the `ls` command,
  but it doesn't. `ARG_MAX` bounds the total space requirement of the `exec*` family of system calls, so the kernel
  knows the largest buffer it will have to allocate. This is all three arguments to `execve`: program name, argument
  vector, and environment. The `ls` command fails because the total bytes taken up by the arguments to `execve` exceeds
  `ARG_MAX`. The `for loop` succeeds because everything is done internally: though the entire list is generated and
  stored, `execve` is never called.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Be careful that `find` doesn't find too many files, since it will recursively descend into all subdirectories by
  default while ls will not. Some versions of find have a `-maxdepth` option to control how deep it goes. Using the
  `for` loop may be easier.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Use the `getconf ARG_MAX` command to see what the limit is on your system. It varies wildly (see also
  `getconf LINE_MAX`).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.17.15. Logging to `syslog` from Your Script

- If you'd like your script to be able to log to `syslog`, use `logger`, Netcat, or `bash`'s builtin network
  redirection features.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `logger` is installed by default on most systems and is an easy way t send message to the local `syslog` service.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  logger -p local0.notice -t ${0##*/}[$$] test message
  ```

- However, it does not send `syslog` to remote hosts by itself. If you need to do that, you can use `bash`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

```bash
echo "<133>${0##*/}[$$]: Test syslog message from bash" \
  > /dev/udp/loghost.example.com/514
```

- Netcat can also be used as an alternative to the previous example. Netcat is known as the "TCP/IP Swiss Army knife",
  and is usually not installed by default. It may also be prohibited as a hacking tool by some security policies,
  though `bash`'s net-redirection features mostly do the same thing.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  echo "<133>${0##*/}[$$]: Test syslog message from Netcat" | nc -w1 -u loghost 514
  ```

#### 1.2.17.16. Using `logger` Correctly

- If you want to use the `logger` tool so your script can send `syslog` messages, but the defaults do not provide
  enough useful information, use `logger` as follows.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  logger -t "${0##*/}[$$]" 'Your message here
  ```

- The `-t` option is for "tag". The `manpage` says `-t` will mark every line with the specified tag. Without `-t`, you
  will have a difficult time finding where your message came from.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The tag of `${0##*/}[$$]` is the base name of your script and the process ID.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ logger -t "${0##*/}[$$]" 'Your message here'

  $ tail -1 /var/log/syslog
  Oct 26 12:16:01 hostname your_script[977]: Your message here

  $ logger 'Your message here'

  $ tail -1 /var/log/syslog
  Oct 26 12:16:01 hostname Your message here

  $
  ```

#### 1.2.17.17. Sending Email from Your Script

- If you'd like your script to be able to send email (optionally with attachments), you must have a compatible mailer
  installed on your system, such as `mail`, `mailto`, or `mailto`, a message transfer agent (MTA) being installed and
  running, and proper configuration of your email environment.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The first way to send mail from your script is to write some code to generate and send a message, like the following
  examples:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  Simple
  cat email_body | \
  mail -s "Message subject" recipient1@example.com recipient2@example.com

  # Attachment only
  uuencode /path/to/attachment_file attachment_name | \
  mail -s "Message Subject" recipient1@example.com recipient2@example.com

  # Attachment and body
  (cat email_body ; uuencode /path/to/attachment_file attachment_name) | \
  mail -s "Message Subject" recipient1@example.com recipient2@example.com
  ```

- While `uuencode` will probably be there, mail and friends may or may not, and their capabilities may vary. In some
  cases, `mail` and `mailx` are even the same program, hard- or soft-linked together. In production, you will want to
  use some abstraction to allow for portability. For example, mail works on Linux and the BSDs, but `mailx` is required
  for Solaris since its mail lacks support for `-s`. `mailx` works on some Linux distributions (e.g., Debian), but not
  others. We choose the mailer based on hostname in the following examples, but depending on your environment using
  `uname -o` might make more sense.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # cookbook filename: email_sample

  # Define some mail settings. Use a case statement with uname or hostname
  # to tweak settings as required for your environment.
  case $HOSTNAME in
    *.company.com ) MAILER='mail' ;; # Linux and BSD
    host1.* ) MAILER='mailx' ;; # Solaris, BSD, and some Linuxes
    host2.* ) MAILER='mailto' ;; # Handy, if installed
  esac

  RECIPIENTS='recipient1@example.com recipient2@example.com'
  SUBJECT="Data from $0"

  [...]
  # Create the body as a file or variable using echo, printf, or a here-document
  # Create or modify $SUBJECT and/or $RECIPIENTS as needed)

  [...]
  ( echo $email_body ; uuencode $attachment $(basename $attachment) ) \
  | $MAILER -s "$SUBJECT" "$RECIPIENTS"
  ```

- Sending attachments like in the previous examples depends somewhat on the client used to read the resulting message.
  Modern clients like Thunderbird and Outlook will detect an `uuencode`d message and present it as an attachment. Other
  clients may not. You can always save the message and `uudecode` it (`uudecode` is smart enough to just skip the
  message part and handle the attachment part), but that can be a major inconvenience.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Another way to send a mail from your script is to outsource the task to `cron`. The exact feature set of `cron`
  varies between systems, but one thing in common is that any output from a `cron` job is mailed to the job's owner or
  the user-defined `MAILTO` variable. The proper way to design a script intended to run from `cron` (and, many would
  argue, any script or Unix tool at all) is to make it silent unless it encounters a warning or error. The reason for
  this is as noted: `cron` emails you all the output. If you get an email message from `cron` every time your script
  runs, you'll soon start ignoring them. But if your script is silent except when there's a problem, you'll only get a
  notification when there is a problem, which is ideal.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `mailto` is intended to be a multimedia- and MIME-aware update to mail, and thus you could avoid using `uuencode` for
  sending attachments, but it's not as widely available as `mail` or `mailx`. If all else fails, `elm` or `mutt` may be
  used in place of `mail`, `mailx`, or `mailto`, though they are even less likely to be installed by default than
  `mail*` by default. The `mpack` program encodes the named file in one or more MIME messages. The resulting messages
  are mailed to one or more recipients, written to a named file or set of files, or posted to a set of newsgroups.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  cat "$message_body" | mutt -s "$subject" -a "$attachment_file" "$recipients"
  ```

- Another way to handle the various names and locations of mail clients is shown in the following example.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # cookbook filename: email_sample_css
  # From Chapter 8 of Classic Shell Scripting
  for MAIL in /bin/mailx /usr/bin/mailx /usr/sbin/mailx /usr/ucb/mailx /bin/mail usr/bin/mail; do
    [ -x $MAIL ] && break
  done

  [ -x $MAIL ] || { echo 'Cannot find a mailer!' >&2; exit 1; }
  ```

- `uuencode` is an old method for translating binary data into ASCII text for transmission over links that could not
  support binary, which is to say most of the internet before it became the internet and the web. We have it on good
  authority that at least some such links still remain, but even if you never encounter one it's still useful to be
  able to convert an attachment into an otherwise ASCII medium in such a way that modern mail clients will recognise
  it. See also `uudecode` and `mimeencode`. Note that `uuencode`d files are about one-third larger than their binary
  equivalent, so you probably want to compress the file before `uuencode`ing it.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The problem with email, aside from the differing frontend mail user agent (MUA) programs like `mail` and `mailx`, is
  that there are a lot of moving parts that must all work together. This is exacerbated by the spam problem: mail
  administrators have had to so severely lock down mail servers that it can easily affect your scripts. In order to
  fully test your solution, and talk to your system and mail administrators if necessary.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- One other problem you might see is that some workstation-oriented Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, don't install
  or run an MTA by default since they assume you will be using a full-featured GUI client such as Evolution or
  Thunderbird. If that's the case, command-line MUAs and email from `cron` won't work either.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.17.18. Automating a Process Using Phases

- Use a `case` statement to break your script into sections or *phases* if you have a long job or process you need to
  automate, but it may require manual intervention and you need to be able to restart at various points in the
  progress.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Use a `case` statement to break your script up into sections or phases.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # cookbook filename: func_choice.1

  # Let the user make a choice about something and return a standardised
  # answer. How the default is handled and what happens next is up to
  # the if/then after the choice in main.
  # Called like: choice <prompt>
  # e.g. choice "Do you want to play a game?"
  # Returns: global variable CHOICE
  function choice {
    CHOICE=''
    local prompt="$*"
    local answer

    read -p "$prompt" answer

    case "$answer" in
      [yY1] ) CHOICE='y';;
      [nN0] ) CHOICE='n';;
      * ) CHOICE="$answer";;
    esac
  } # end of function choice
  ```

- Then, set up phases as shown in the following example.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # cookbook filename: using_phases
  # Main loop
  until [ "$phase" = "Finished." ]; do
    case $phase in
      phase0 )
        ThisPhase=0
        NextPhase="$(( $ThisPhase + 1 ))"
        echo '############################################'
        echo "Phase$ThisPhase = Initialisation of FooBarBaz build"

        # Things that should only be initialised at the beginning of a
        # new build cycle go here
        # ...

        echo "Phase${ThisPhase}=Ending"
        phase="phase$NextPhase"
      ;;

      # ...

      phase20 )
        ThisPhase=20
        NextPhase="$(( $ThisPhase + 1 ))"
        echo '############################################'
        echo "Phase$ThisPhase = Main processing for FooBarBaz build"

        # ...

        choice "[P$ThisPhase] Do we need to stop and fix anything? [y/N]: "

        if [ "$choice" = "y" ]; then
          echo "Re-run '$MYNAME phase${ThisPhase}' after handling this."
          exit $ThisPhase
        fi

        echo "Phase${ThisPhase}=Ending"
        phase="phase$NextPhase"
      ;;
      # ...
      * )
        echo "What the heck?!? We should never get HERE! Gonna croak!"
        echo "Try $0 -h"
        exit 99
        phase="Finished."
      ;;
    esac

    printf "%b" "\a" # Ring the bell
  done
  ```

#### 1.2.17.19. Doing Two Things at Once

- As of `bash` version 4, the `coproc` command can allow to processes to converse with each other, each reading as its
  input the output of the other command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The following example uses the `bc` program, an arbitrary-precision calculator language, as a co-process, allowing
  `bash` to send calculations to `bc` and read back the results. It's one way of giving `bash` the ability to do
  floating-point calculations, although the following example shows the usage of `coproc`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # cookbook filename: fpmath
  # using coproc for floating-point math

  # Initialise the coprocess call this first before attempting any calls to fpmath
  function fpinit () {
    coproc /usr/bin/bc
    bcin=${COPROC[1]}
    bcout=${COPROC[0]}
    echo "scale=5" >& ${bcin}
  }

  # compute with floating-point numbers
  # by sending the args to bc
  # then reading its response
  function fpmath() {
    echo "$@" >& ${bcin}
    if read -t 0.25 -u ${bcout} responz
    then
      echo "$responz"
    fi
  }

  ############################
  # Main
  fpinit

  while read aline
  do
    answer=$(fpmath "$aline")
    if [[ -n $answer ]]
    then
      echo $answer
    fi
  done
  ```

- `bash` must be compiled with `--enable-coprocesses` for the previous example to work. That is the default, but some
  packages may not have it.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `coproc` will execute a command (or pipeline of commands) alongside the current shell process. It creates two pipes,
  one connected to the standard output of the command and one connected to its standard output. These connections are
  stored in a shell array called `COPROC` by default. Index 0 of that array holds the output file descriptor of that
  process; index 1 holds the input file descriptor of that process.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The output of the coprocesses can act as the input to the calling process (the shell script), and vice versa.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Versions of `bash` that are new enough to have the `coproc` command are also new enough to support a fractional value
  for the timeout value. Older versions only allowed integers.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.17.20. Running an SSH Command on Multiple Hosts

- If you need to run a command over SSH on multiple hosts, wrap your SSH command in a `for` loop.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ for host in host1 host2 host3; do echo -n "On $host, I am: " ;
  > ssh $host 'whoami' ; done
  On host1, I am: root
  On host2, I am: jp
  On host3, I am: jp

  $
  ```

- There are a few points to keep in mind with the approach in the previous code example.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Assume all of the underlying networking and the firewall, DNS, and similar aspects are already working and are
    accessible by the machine on which you are running the for loop.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - It is much more convenient to run the SSH command when your are using SSH keys.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - You can quickly run into quoting issues in the SSH command.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    $ for host in host{1..3};
    > do echo "$host:" ;
    > ssh $host 'grep "$HOSTNAME" /etc/hosts' ;
    > done
    ```

    - The solution to quoting issues in the SSH command can be resolved by enclosing the `ssh` command in single quotes
      so that the local `bash` shell will not interpolate it, and enclose the `grep` argument in double quotes for
      clarity, since that is not strictly needed.
      [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    - You can handle the problems of `grep`-ing for single quotes and using any variables required by `bash` by
      enclosing the `ssh` command in double quotes, then escaping any variables and/or double quotes needed on the
      remote side, but it can get ugly fast.
      [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

      ```bash
      $ for host in host{1..3};
      > do ssh $host "echo \"Local '$host' is remote '\$HOSTNAME'\"";
      > done
      Local 'host1' is remote 'host1'
      Local 'host2' is remote 'host2'
      Local 'host3' is remote 'host3'

      $
      ```

### 1.2.18. Configuring & Customising `bash`

- `bash` gives you a very powerful and flexible environment. Part of that flexibility is the extent to which it can be
  customised.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- This chapter shows how to configure `bash` to suit your individual needs and style.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You can alter the way `bash` behaves; for example, you can make it case-insensitive, so that it doesn't care about
  the difference between upper- and lower-case.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.18.1. `bash` Startup Options

- If you'd like to understand the various options you can use when starting `bash`, but `bash --help` is not helping
  you, you can try `bash -c "help set"` and `bash -c help`, or `help set` and `help` if you are already running in a
  `bash` shell.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- As shown in this section, `bash` can have several different ways to set the same option. You can set an option on
  startup, then later turn off the same option interactively.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.18.2. Customising Your Prompt

- Customise the `$PS1` and `$PS2` variables as you desire to add more useful information to the default `bash` prompt,
  which is usually something uninformative that ends in with `$` and doesn't tell you much.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The default prompt varies depending on your system. `bash` itself will show its major and minor version `(\s-\v\$)`,
  e.g., `bash-3.00$`. Your operating system may have its own default
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The following are basic prompts that will work with `bash` 1.14.7 or newer. The trailing `\$` displays `#` if you are
  `root` (i.e., the effective UID is `0`) and `$` otherwise.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `<username>@<host_name>`, the date and time, and the current working directory.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    $ export PS1='[\u@\h \d \A] \w \$ '

    [jp@freebsd Wed Dec 28 19:32] /usr/local/bin $
    ```

  - `<username>@<long_host_name>`, the date and time (in ISO 8601 format), and the base name of the current working
    directory (`\W`).
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    $ export PS1='[\u@\h \V \w] \$ '
    [jp@freebsd 3.00.16] ~ $ cd /usr/local/bin/
    [jp@freebsd 3.00.16] /usr/local/bin $
    ```

  - New line, `<username>@<host_name>`, base PTY, shell level, history number, new line, and full working directory
    name (`$PWD`).
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    - PTY is the number of the pseudo-terminal (in Linux terminals) to which you are connected. This is useful when you
      have more than one session and you are trying to keep track of which is which.
      [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    - Shell level is the depth of the subshells you are in. When you first log in, it's 1, and it increments as you run
      subprocesses (such as `screen`).
      [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    - The history line is the number of the current command in the command history.
      [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    $ export PS1='\n[\u@\h \l:$SHLVL:\!]\n$PWD\$ '

    /home/jp$ cd /usr/local/bin/

    [jp@freebsd ttyp0:3:22]
    /usr/local/bin$
    ```

  - `<username>@<host_name>`, the exit status of the last command, and the current working directory. The exit status
    will be reset (and thus useless) if you execute any commands from the prompt.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    $ export PS1='[\u@\h $? \w \$ '

    ```

  - New line, `<username>@<host_name>`, the number of jobs the shell is currently managing.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    working directory.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    /home/jp$
    ```

  - New line, `<username>@<host_name>`, `T` for terminal, `L` for shell level, `C` for command number, and date and
    time (in ISO 8601 format).
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```

- The following are fancy prompts that use ANSI escape sequences for colours, or to set the contents of the title bar
  in an xterm - but be aware these will not always work. Escape sequences should be surrounded by `\[` and `\]`, which
  tells `bash` that the enclosed characters are non-printing. Otherwise, `bash` (technically, `readline`) will be
  confused about line lengths and wrap lines in the wrong place.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `<username>@<host_name>`, and the current working directory in light blue (colour not shown in print).
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash

    [jp@freebsd:~]$
    [jp@freebsd:~]$ cd /tmp
    [jp@freebsd:/tmp]$
    ```

  - `<username>@<host_name>`, and the current working directory (in both the xterm title bar and the prompt itself).
    Garbage may be generated if you are not running in an xterm..
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    $ export PS1='\[\033]0;\u@\h:\w\007\][\u@\h:\w]\$ '
    [jp@ubuntu:~]$
    [jp@ubuntu:~]$ cd /tmp
    [jp@ubuntu:/tmp]$
    ```

  - Both the colour and xterm updates.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

    ```bash
    $ PS1='\[\033]0;\u@\h:\w\007\]\[\033[1;34m\][\u@\h:\w]\$\[\033[0m\] '

    ```

- The `export` command only needs to be used one to flag a variable to be exported to child processes.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Assuming the `promptvars` shell option is set (which it is by default), prompt strings are decoded and expanded (via
  parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion), quotes are removed, and they are finally
  displayed. Prompt strings are `$PS0`, `$PS1`, `$PS2`, `$PS$`, `$PS4`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `$PS0`: Only available in `bash` version 4.4 or newer.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `$PS1`: The command prompt.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `$PS2`: The secondary prompt displayed when `bash` needs more information to complete a command. It defaults to
    `>`, but you may use anything you like.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `$PS3`: The `select` prompt, which defaults to `#?`.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `$PS4`: The `xtrace` (debugging) prompt, with a default of `+`. The first character of `$PS4` is replicated as many
    times as needed to denote levels of indirection in the current executing command.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ export PS2='Secondary> '

  $ for i in *
  Secondary> do
  Secondary> echo $i
  Secondary> done
  cheesy_app
  data_file
  hard_to_kill
  mcd
  mode

  $ export PS3='Pick me: '

  $ select item in 'one two three'; do echo $item; done
  1) one two three
  Pick me: ^C

  $ export PS4='+ debugging> '

  $ set -x

  $ echo $( echo $( for i in *; do echo $i; done ) )
  +++ debugging> for i in '*'
  +++ debugging> echo cheesy_app
  +++ debugging> for i in '*'
  +++ debugging> echo data_file
  +++ debugging> for i in '*'

  + debugging> echo cheesy_app data_file hard_to_kill mcd mode
  cheesy_app data_file hard_to_kill mcd mode
  ```

- Since the `$PS1` prompt is only useful when you are running `bash` interactively, the best place is to set it in
  `/etc/bashrc` (globally) or `~/.bashrc` (locally).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- It is recommended to add a space  as the last character in the `$PS1` string. It makes it easier to read what is on
  your screen by separating the prompt string from the commands that you type. Because your string may contain other
  spaces or special characters, it is a good idea to use double (or even single) quotes to quote the string when you
  assign it to `$PS1`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.18.3. A Prompt Before Your Program Runs

- If you want to prompt print before the program runs (not just after it completes), and you are using using `bash` 4.4
  or newer, you can you use the `$PS0` prompt introduced in `bash` 4.4. If set, the prompt string will be evaluated and
  printed prior to the execution of any command that you have typed.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The following is a way to use both `$PS0` and `$PS1` to display start and end timestamps of commands that you run.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  PS0=' \t\n'
  PS1='----------------------------------------------- \t\n\! \$ '
  ```

- The pre-execution prompt is $PS0. It will be displayed just before the shell begins to execute your command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The key element of both of these prompts is the `\t`. It will be translated into the timestamp. The `\n` is just a
  newline for proper formatting. If you set both prompts, as shown in the previous example, and then run a command that
  may take a bit of time, like `sleep 5`, then you can see the resulting timestamps like in the following code block.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  1037 $ echo 'sleep...' ; sleep 5; echo 'awake!'

  21:36:59
  sleep...
  awake!
  ----------------------------------------------- 21:37:04

  1038 $
  ```

- The timestamp resolution is only in seconds, so it is not meant for precise performance measurements, but it can be
  very useful in looking back over a series of commands to see what transpired and which commands took a long time to
  run.

#### 1.2.18.4. Changing Your `$PATH` Permanently

- If you need to permanently change your path, you need to first discover where the path is set and then update it. For
  your local account, it's probably set in `~/.profile` or `~/.bash_profile`. Find the file with
  `grep --files-with-matches PATH ~/.[^.]*` and edit it with your favourite editor; then source the file to have the
  change take effect immediately. If you are `root` and you need to set the path for the entire system, the basic
  procedure is the same, but there are different files in `/etc` where the `$PATH` may be set, depending on your
  operating system and version. The most likely file is `/etc/profile`, but `/etc/bashrc`, `/etc/rc`,
  `/etc/default/login`, `~/.ssh/environment`, and the PAM `/etc/environment` files are also possible.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The locations listed in the `$PATH` have security implications, especially when you are root. If a world-writeable
  directory is in root's path before the typical directories (i.e., `/bin`, `/sbin`), then a local user can create
  files that root might execute, doing arbitrary things to the system. This is the reason that the current directory
  (`.`) should not be in root's path either. To avoid this issue, do the following:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Make `root`'s path as short as possible.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Never use relative paths.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Avoid having world-writeable directories in `root`'s path.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Consider setting explicit paths in shell scripts run by `root`.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Consider hard-coding absolute paths to utilities used in shell scripts run by `root`.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Put user or application directories last in the `$PATH`, and then only for privileged users.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.18.5. Changing Your `$PATH` Temporarily

- If you want to add one or more directories to your `$PATH` (or remove one or more) for only the current session in a
  terminal, there are several solutions to handle that that problem.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You can prepend or append a new directory using `PATH="new_dir:$PATH"` or `PATH="$PATH:new_dir"`, though you should
  ensure the directory isn't already in the `$PATH` first.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If you need to edit something in the middle of the path, you can echo the path to the screen, then use your
  terminal's kill and yank (copy and paste) facility to duplicate it on a new line and edit it.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- You can add the following macros identified from the `readline` documentation. Pressing `<Ctrl> + x + p` will display
  the `$PATH` on the current line for you to edit, while typing any variable names and pressing `<Meta> + <Ctrl> + v`
  (where `<Meta>` is `<Super>` in Linux, `<Windows>` in Windows, `<Command>` in Mac) will display that variable for
  editing.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # edit the path
  "\C-xp": "PATH=${PATH}\e\C-e\C-a\ef\C-f"

  # [...]

  # Edit variable on current line.
  "\M-\C-v": "\C-a\C-k$\C-y\M-\C-e\C-a\C-y="
  ```

- For simple cases, you could use the following simple function. The `egrep` pattern looks for the value in `$1`
  between two pipe characters (`|`) or colons (`:`), at the beginning (`^`) or end (`$`) of the `$PATH` string.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # cookbook filename: func_pathmunge

  # Adapted from Red Hat Linux

  function pathmunge {
    if ! echo $PATH | /bin/egrep -q "(^|:)$1($|:)" ; then
      if [ "$2" = "after" ] ; then
        PATH="$PATH:$1"
      else
        PATH="$1:$PATH"
      fi
    fi
  }
  ```

- For a more complicated use case than in the previous code example, and with plenty of error checking, use the
  following examples.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  }
  ```

- You can use the functions from the previous code block like in the following examples.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ source chpath

  $ echo $PATH
  /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/X11R6/bin:/home/jp/bin

  $ add_to_path post '~/foo'
  -bash:add_to_path: can't add relative directory '~/foo' to the $PATH

  $ rm_from_path /home/jp/bin

  $ echo $PATH

  $ add_to_path /home/jp/bin
  -bash:add_to_path: requires a location and a directory to add
  e.g. add_to_path pre /bin

  $ add_to_path post /home/jp/bin

  $ add_to_path pre /home/jp/bin

  $ echo $PATH
  /home/jp/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/X11R6/bin
  ```

#### 1.2.18.6. Setting Your `$CDPATH`

- If you want to make it easier to switch between several directories in various locations, set your `$CDPATH`
  appropriately. Your commonly used directories will likely be unique.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- For an example, if you are working a lot with `init`'s `rc` directories.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  /home/jp$ cd rc3.d
  bash: cd: rc3.d: No such file or directory

  /home/jp$ export CDPATH='.:/etc'

  /home/jp$ cd rc3.d
  /etc/rc3.d

  /etc/rc3.d$ cd rc5.d
  /etc/rc5.d

  /etc/rc5.d$ cd games
  bash: cd: games: No such file or directory

  /etc/rc5.d$ export CDPATH='.:/etc:/usr'
  /etc/rc5.d$ cd games

  /usr/games

  /usr/games$
  ```

- `$CDPATH` is a colon-separated list of directories used as a search path for the `cd` builtin command. Think of it as
  `$PATH` for the `cd` command. If the argument to `cd` begins with a slash, `$CDPATH` will not be used. If `$CDPATH`
  is used, the absolute pathname to the new directory is printed to `STDOUT`, like in the example in this section.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Be careful running bash in POSIX mode (e.g., as `/bin/sh` or with `--posix`). If a non-empty directory name from
  `$CDPATH` is used, or if `-` is the first argument, and the directory change is successful, the absolute pathname of
  the new working directory is written to the standard output. Every time oyu use `cd`, it will echo the new path to
  `STDOUT`, which is not the standard behaviour.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Common directories to include in `$CDPATH` are as follows:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `.`: The current directory. This is optional, because this is implied.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `~/`: Your home directory.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `..`: The parent directory.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `../..`: The grandparent directory.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `~/.dirlinks`: A hidden directory containing nothing but symbolic links to other commonly used directories.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The following common suggestions result in the following assignment for `$CDPATH`.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  export CDPATH='.:~/:..:../..:~/.dirlinks'
  ```

#### 1.2.18.7. When Programs Are Not Found

- If you want better control over what happens when a command is not found, perhaps to give a better message, you can
  add something like the following to the top of your script or `rc` file.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  function command_not_found_handle ()
  {
    echo "Sorry. $0: $1 not there."
    return 1
  }
  ```

- In `bash` 4.3 and later there is a special function that is called if the shell cannot find the executable you want
  to run. The function is called `command_not_found_handle`, and you can (re)define it for your custom purposes, like
  the example in this section.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- It is important that your function return a non-zero value to indicate that the invocation of the command did not
  succeed. Other parts of your script, or other callers of your script, may be depending on that information.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.18.8. Shortening or Changing Command Names

- If you'd like to shorten a long or complex command you use often, or if you'd like to rename a command, do not
  manually rename or move executable files, as many aspects of Unix and Linux depend on certain commands existing in
  certain places; instead you should use aliases, functions, and possibly symbolic links.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Aliases allow a string to be substituted for a word when it is used as the first word of a simple command. The shell
  maintains a list of aliases that may be set and unset with the `alias` and `unalias` builtin commands. You can rename
  commands, or create a macro, by listing many commands in one alias, e.g., `alias copy="cp"` or `alias ll.="ls -ld .*`
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Aliases are only expanded once, so you can change how a command words, without going into an endless loop. Aliases
  are strictly text substitutions; they cannot use arguments to themselves, i.e., `alias="mkdir $1 && cd $1"` because
  that doesn't work.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Functions are used in two different ways. First, they can be sourced into your interactive shell, where they
  essentially become shell scripts that are always head in memory. They are usually small, and are very fast since they
  are already in memory and are executed in the current process, not in a spawned subshell. Secondly, they may be used
  within a script as subroutines. Functions do allow arguments.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- For personal or system-wide use, you are probably better off using aliases or functions to rename or tweak commands,
  but symbolic links are very useful in allowing a command to be in more than one place at a time. For example, Linux
  systems almost always use `/bin/bash` while other systems may use `/usr/bin/bash`, `/usr/local/bin/bash`, or
  `/usr/pkg/bin/bash`. While there is a better way to handle this particular issue in general symbolic links may be
  used as a workaround. It is recommended to not use hard links, as they are harder to see if you are not looking for
  them, and they are more easily disrupted by badly behaved editors and such. Symbolic links are just more obvious and
  intuitive.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Usually, only the first word of a command line is checked for alias expansion. However, if the last character of the
  value of that alias is a space, the next word will be checked as well. In practice, this is rarely an issue.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Since in `bash` aliases can't use arguments (unlike in `csh`), you'll need to use a function if you need to pass in
  arguments. Because both aliases and functions reside in memory, this is not a big difference.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Unless the `expand_aliases` shell option is set, aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive. Best
  practices for writing scripts dictate that you not use aliases, since they may not be present on another system. You
  also need to define functions inside your script, or explicitly source them before use. Thus, the best place to
  define them is in your global `/etc/bashrc` or your local `~/.bashrc`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.18.9. Adjusting Shell Behaviour & Environment

- If you'd like to adjust your shell environment to account for the way you work, your physical location, your
  language, etc, there are three ways to adjust various aspects of your environment. set is standardised in POSIX and
  uses one-letter options. shopt is specifically for bash shell options. And there are many environment variables in
  use for historical reasons, as well as for compatibility with many third-party applications.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.18.10. Adjusting `readline` Behaviour Using `.inputrc`

- Edit or create a `~/.inputrc` or `/etc/inputrc` file if you'd like to adjust the way `bash` handles input, especially
  command completion. To have `readline` use your file when it initialises, set `$INPUTRC` (e.g.,
  `INPUTRC=~/".inputrc"`. Use `bind -f <file_name` to reread the file and apply or test it after making changes.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # This is a SUBSET of interesting inputrc settings, see Chapter 16:
  # "Getting Started with a Custom Configuration" for a longer example
  # To reread (and implement changes to this file) use:
  # bind -f $SETTINGS/inputrc

  # First, include any system-wide bindings and variable
  # assignments from /etc/inputrc
  # (fails silently if file doesn't exist)

  $include /etc/inputrc

  $if Bash
    # Ignore case when doing completion
    set completion-ignore-case on
    # Completed dir names have a slash appended
    set mark-directories on
    # Completed names which are symlinks to dirs have a slash appended
    set mark-symlinked-directories on
    # List ls -F for completion
    set visible-stats on
    # Cycle through ambiguous completions instead of list

  $endif
  ```

#### 1.2.18.11. Keeping a Private Stash of Utilities by Adding `~/bin`

- You have a stash of personal utilities you like to use, but you are not root on the system and can't place them into
  the normal locations like `/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`, or there is some other reason to separate them, you can create
  a `~/bin` directory, place your utilities in it, and add it to your path.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  PATH="$PATH:~/bin"
  ```

- You'll want to make this change in one of your shell initialisation files, such as `~/.bashrc`. Some systems already
  add `$HOME/bin` as the last directory in a non-privileged user account by default, so check that first before adding
  it to your `bash` configuration.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- It's inconvenient to invoke scripts with their full pathname. By collecting your scripts in a `~/bin` directory, you
  can make your scripts look like regular Unix programs - at least to you.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- For security reasons, don't put your bin directory at the start of your path. Starting your path with `~/bin` makes
  it easy to override system commands, which is inconvenient if it happens  accidentally and dangerous if it's done
  maliciously.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.18.12. Using Secondary Prompts: `$PS2`, `$PS3`, `$PS4`

- `$PS2` is called the secondary prompt string. It is used to interactively enter a command that you have not completed
  yet. It is usually set `>`, but you can redefine it.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ export PS2='Secondary: '

  $ for i in $(ls)
  Secondary: do
  Secondary: echo $i
  Secondary: done
  colors
  deepdir
  trunc_PWD
  ```

- `$PS3` is the `select` prompt, and is used by the `select` statement to prompt the user for a value. It defaults to
  `#?`, which is not very intuitive. You should change it before using the `select` command.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ select i in $(ls)
  Secondary: do
  Secondary: echo $i
  Secondary: done
  1) colors
  2) deepdir
  3) trunc_PWD
  #? 1
  colors
  #? ^C

  $ export PS3='Choose a directory to echo: '

  $ select i in $(ls); do echo $i; done
  1) colors
  2) deepdir
  3) trunc_PWD
  Choose a directory to echo: 2
  deepdir
  Choose a directory to echo: ^C
  ```

- `$PS4` is displayed during trace output. Its first character is shown as many times as necessary to denote the
  nesting depth. The default is `+`. The `$PS4` prompt uses the `$LINENO` variable, which returns the line number in
  the function. The single quotes also defers expansion of the variable until display time.

#### 1.2.18.13. Synchronising Shell History Between Sessions

- If you run more than one `bash` session at a time and you would like to have a shared history between them, and you'd
  also like to prevent the last session closed from clobbering the history from any other sessions, you can use the
  `history` command to synchronise your history between sessions manually or automatically.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Using the default settings, the last shell to gracefully exit will overwrite your history file, so unless it is
  synchronized with any other shells you had open at the same time, it will clobber their histories.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Manually synchronising history involves writing an alias to append the current history to the history file
  (`history -a`), then rereading anything new in that file into the current shell's history (`history -n`). The
  disadvantage to this approach is that you must manually run the commands in each shell when you want to synchronise
  your history.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  alias hs="history -a ; history -n"
  ```

- To automate the synchronisation of a history file, you could use the following `$PROMPT_COMMAND` variable. The value
  of `$PROMPT_COMMAND` is interpreted as a command to execute each time the default interactive prompt, `$PS1`, is
  displayed. The disadvantage to that approach is that it runs those commands every time `$PS1` is displayed. That is
  very often, and on a heavily loaded or slower system that can cause a significant slowdown in your shell, especially
  if you have a large history.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.18.14. Setting Shell History Options

- If you'd like more control over your command line history, use the `$HIST*` variables and shell options as desired.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The `$HISTFILESIZE` variable sets the number of lines permitted in the `$HISTFILE`. The default for `$HISTFILESIZE`
  is 500 lines, and `$HISTFILE` is `~/.bash_history` unless you are in POSIX mode, in which case it's `~/.sh_history`.
  Increasing `$HISTFILESIZE` may be useful, and unsetting it causes the `$HISTFILE` length to be unlimited. Changing
  `$HISTFILE` probably isn't necessary, except that if it is not set or the file is not writeable, no history will be
  written to disk. The `$HISTSIZE` variable sets the number of lines permitted in the history stack in memory.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `$HISTIGNORE` and `$HISTCONTROL` control what goes into your history in the first place. `$HISTIGNORE` is more
  flexible since it allows you to specify patterns to decide what command lines to save to the history. `$HISTCONTROL`
  is more limited in that it supports only the few keywords listed below:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `ignorespace`: Command lines that begin with a space character are not saved in the history list.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `ignoredups`: Command lines that match the previous history entry are not saved in the history list.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `ignoreboth`: Shorthand for both `ignorespace` and `ignoredups`.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `erasedups`: All previous commands that match the current line are removed from the history line before that line
    is saved.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If `$HISTCONTROL` is not set, or does not contain any of these keywords, all commands are saved to the history list,
  subject to processing `$HISTIGNORE`. The second and subsequent lines of a multi-line compound command are not tested,
  and are added to the history regardless of the value of `$HISTCONTROL`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If set and non-null, the `$HISTTIMEFORMAT` variable available in bash 3 and later specifies an `strftime` format
  string to use when displaying or writing the history.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- There are also shell options to configure history file handling. If `histappend` is set, the shell appends to the
  history file; otherwise, it overwrites the history file. Note that it is still truncated to `$HISTFILESIZE`. If
  `cmdhist` is set, multi-line commands are saved as a single line, with semicolons added as needed. If `lithist` is
  set, multi-line commands are saved with embedded newlines.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.18.15. Creating a Better `cd` Command

- If you `cd` into a lot of nested directory and would be able to type `cd ...` instead of `cd ../../../..` to navigate
  up four levels, as an example, you can use the following function to enable that behaviour.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # cookbook filename: func_cd

  # Allow use of 'cd ...' to cd up 2 levels, 'cd ....' up 3, etc. (like 4NT/4DOS)
  # Usage: cd ..., etc.
  function cd {
    local option= length= count= cd_path= i= # Local scope and start clean

    # If we have a -L or -P symlink option, save then remove it
    if [ "$1" = "-P" -o "$1" = "-L" ]; then
    option="$1"
    shift
    fi

    # Are we using the special syntax? Make sure $1 isn't empty, then
    # match the first 3 characters of $1 to see if they are '...', then
    # make sure there isn't a slash by trying a substitution; if it fails,
    # there's no slash.
    if [ -n "$1" -a "${1:0:3}" = '...' -a "$1" = "${1%/*}" ]; then
      # We are using special syntax
      length=${#1} # Assume that $1 has nothing but dots and count them
      count=2      # 'cd ..' still means up one level, so ignore first two

      # While we haven't run out of dots, keep cd'ing up 1 level
      for ((i=$count;i<=$length;i++)); do
        cd_path="${cd_path}../" # Build the cd path
      done

      # Actually do the cd
      builtin cd $option "$cd_path"
    elif [ -n "$1" ]; then
      # We are NOT using special syntax; just plain old cd by itself
      builtin cd $option "$*"
    else
      # We are NOT using special syntax; plain old cd by itself to home dir
      builtin cd $option
    fi
  }
  ```

- The `cd` command takes an optional `-L` or `-P` argument that, respectively, follows symbolic links or the physical
  directory structure. Either way, they must be taken into account if you want to redefine how `cd` works.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.18.16. Creating & Changing Into a New Directory in One Step

- If you find that you often create new directories and immediately navigate to them to perform some operation, then
  all that typing can get tedious, add the following function to an appropriate configuration file (such as your
  `~/.bashrc`) in order to avoid this issue in future.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # cookbook filename: func_mcd

  # mkdir new_directory then cd into it
  # usage: mcd (<mode>) <dir>
  function mcd {
    local new_directory='_mcd_command_failed_'

    if [ -d "$1" ]; then # Dir exists, mention that...
      echo "$1 exists..."
      new_directory="$1"
    else
      if [ -n "$2" ]; then # We've specified a mode
        command mkdir -p -m $1 "$2" && new_directory="$2"
      else # Plain old mkdir
        command mkdir -p "$1" && new_directory="$1"
      fi
    fi

    builtin cd "$new_directory" # No matter what, cd into it
  }
  ```

- The following is an example of using the function in the previous code example.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ source mcd

  $ pwd
  /home/jp

  $ mcd 0700 junk

  $ pwd
  /home/jp/junk

  $ ls -ld .
  drwx------ 2 jp users 512 Dec 6 01:03 .
  ```

- This function allows you to optionally specify a mode for the `mkdir` command to use when creating the directory. If
  the directory already exists, it will mention that fact but still `cd` into it. The `command` command is used to
  ensure that any shell functions for `mkdir` and the `builtin` command are ignored to ensure only the shell `cd` is
  used.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The value of `_mcd_command_failed_` is also assigned to a local variable in case the `mkdir` command fails. If it is
  successful, the correct new directory is assigned for navigation by `cd`. If it fails, when the `cd` tries to
  navigate to the directory, an error message will be displayed, assuming there is no `_mcd_command_failed_` directory
  in your file system.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- One pitfall if you could easily improve this section's first solution, by using `break` or `exit` if the `mkdir`
  fails. However, `break` only works in a `for`, `while`, or `until` loop, and `exit` will actually exit your shell,
  since a sourced function runs in the same process as the shell.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  command mkdir -p "$1" && new_directory="$1" || exit 1 # This will exit our shell
  command mkdir -p "$1" && new_directory="$1" || break # This will fail
  ```

- You could also place the following in a trivial function, but it is far less robust than the other version provided
  in this section.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  function mcd {
    mkdir "$1" && cd "$1"
  }
  ```

#### 1.2.18.17. Getting to the Bottom of Things

- If you work in a lot of narrow but deep directory structures (where all of the content is as the bottom), and you
  find it tedious to manually `cd` through so many levels, you can use the following `alias` to get to the "bottom" of
  the file structure.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  alias bot='cd $(dirname $(find . | tail -n 1))'
  ```

  - This use of find in a large directory structure such as `/usr` could take a while and isn't recommended.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Depending on how the configuration of this file structure, this may not work for you; you'll have to try it and
    see.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The `find .` will simply list all the files and directories in the current directory and below.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The tail -n 1 will grab the last line.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `dirname` will extract just the path.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `cd` will take you there.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- It may be possible for you to tweak the command to be more precise on where you wish to navigate in the file
  structure, for example.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  alias bot='cd $(dirname $(find . | sort -r | tail -n 5 | head -1))'
  ```

#### 1.2.18.18. Adding New Features to `bash` Using Loadable Built-ins

- If you have something that you'd like `bash` to do, but there's no built-in command for it, or, for efficient
  reasons, use the dynamically loadable built-ins introduced in `bash` version 2.0.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The `bash` archive contains a number of pre-written built-ins in the directory `./examples/loadables/`, especially
  the canonical `hello.c`. You can build them by uncommenting the lines in the file `Makefile` that are relevant to
  your system, and typing `make`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- On systems that support dynamic loading, you can write your own built-ins in C, compile them into shared objects, and
  load them at any time from within the shell with the `enable` built-in.

- The recipes in this chapter cover tasks that occur in the course of using or administrating computers.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.19.1. Renaming Many Files

- If you want to rename many files, but `mv *.foo *.bar` doesn't work, or if you want to rename a group of files in
  arbitrary ways, you can use the following script to rename a number of files using a `for` loop.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  for FN in *.bad
  do
    mv "${FN}" "${FN%bad}bash"
  done
  ```

- For more arbitrary changes, e.g., you are writing a book and want the chapter filenames to follow a certain format,
  but the publisher has a conflicting format. You could name the files like `chNN=Title=Author.odt`, then use a simple
  `for` loop and `cut` in a command substitution to rename them.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Initial Command

  $ for i in *.odt; do mv "$i" "$(echo "$i" | cut -d'=' -f1,3)"; done

  # Testing

  $ for i in *.odt; do echo "<$i>" "<$(echo "$i" | cut -d'=' -f1,3)>"; done

  ```

- Don't name your script `rename`. There are at least two different `rename` commands in major Linux, and there are
  certainly many others.

#### 1.2.19.2. Using GNU Texinfo & `info` on Linux

- If you are having trouble accessing documentation because much of the documentation for GNU tools on Linux is in
  Texinfo documents, the traditional manpages are just stubs, and the default info program is user-hostile (and you
  don't feel like learning yet another single-use program), pipe the `info` command into a useful pager, such as
  `less`, but you will lose `info`'s link navigation features.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  info bash | less
  ```

- `info` is essentially a standalone version of the Emacs info reader, so if you are an Emacs fan, maybe it will make
  sense to you. However, piping it into `less` is a quick and simple way to view the documentation using a tool with
  which you're already familiar.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The idea behind Texinfo is good: generate various output formats from a single source. It's not new, since many other
  markup languages exist to do the same thing. However, it is not used for manpages, as they follow a standard,
  structures, and time-tested format while Texinfo is more free-form. There are other other Texinfo viewers and
  converters, such as `pinfo`, `info2www`, `tkman`, and even `info2man`.

#### 1.2.19.3. Unzipping Many ZIP Files

- If you want to unzip many ZIP files in a directory, but `unzip *.zip` doesn't work, put the pattern in single quotes,
  because (unlike most other Unix commands) `unzip` handles file globbing patterns itself.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  unzip '*.zip'
  ```

- You could also use a loop to unzip each file.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  for x in /path/to/date*/name/*.zip; do unzip "$x"; done
  ```

- Unlike many Unix commands (e.g., `gzip` and `bzip2`), the last argument to `unzip` isn't any arbitrary long list of
  files.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The first example in this section prevents the shell from expanding the wildcard by using single quotes. However,
  that only works if there is only one wildcard. The second example works around that issue by running an explicit
  `unzip` command for each ZIP file found when the shell expands the wildcards.

#### 1.2.19.4. Recovering Disconnected Sessions Using `screen`

- If you run long processes over SSH, perhaps over the WAN, and when you get disconnected you lose a lot of work. You
  could run your process using `nohup`, but then you won't be able to reattach to it when your connection recovers.
  Installing and using GNU `screen` is the best solution.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Using `screen` is very simple. Type `screen` or `screen -a`. The `-a` option includes all of `screen`'s capabilities,
  at the expense of some redraw (thus bandwidth) efficiency.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- If you use the `screen` command, it will look like nothing happened, but you are now running inside a `screen`.
  `echo $SHLVL` should return a number greater than one if this worked. To test it, do an `ls -la`, then `kill` your
  terminal (do not exit cleanly, as you will also exit `screen`). Log back into the machine and type `screen -r` to
  reconnect to screen. If that doesn't put you back where you left off, try `screen -d -r`. If that doesn't work, try
  `ps auwx | grep [s]creen` to see if screen is still running, and then try man screen for troubleshooting information
  - but it should just work.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Starting `screen` with something like the following will make it easier to figure out what session to reattach to
  later if necessary.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  screen -aS "$(whoami).$(date$$'$$ $$+$$%Y-%m-%d$$_$$%H:%M:%S%z$$'$$)
  ```

- You can have more than one `screen` session in a single SSH terminal. `screen` also allows you to SSH into a machine,
  start a process, disconnect your terminal, then reconnect and pick up - not where you left off, but where the process
  has continued to. It also allows multiple people to share a single session for training, troubleshooting, or
  collaboration.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `screen` is often installed by default on Linux, but rarely on other systems. The `screen` binary must run as SUID
  `root` so it can write to the appropriate `/usr/dev/` pseudo-terminals (PTYs). If `screen` doesn't work, this is
  likely the reason. To fix it, run the command `chmod u+s /usr/bin/screen` as `root`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- `screen` also interfaces with inline transfer protocols like `zmodem`. Newer versions of `screen` have configuration
  settings that support this.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The default Emacs mode of bash command-line editing uses `<Ctrl> + a` to go to the start of the line. That's also the
  `screen` command mode, or meta key, so if you use `<Ctrl> + a` a lot, you may want to add the following to your
  `~/.screenrc` file.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  # Sample settings for ~/.screenrc
  # Change the C-a default to C-n (use C-n n to send literal ^N)
  escape ^Nn

  # Yes annoying audible bell, please
  vbell off

  # Detach on hangup
  autodetach on

  # Make the shell in every window a login shell
  shell -$SHELL
  ```

#### 1.2.19.5. Sharing a Single `bash` Session

- If you need to share a single `bash` session for any reason, you can use GNU `screen` in multi-user mode.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- As the host, perform the following step to enable sharing of a single `bash` session among multiple users.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Enter `screen -S <session_name>`.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Enter `<Ctrl> + a` (the default meta key) `addacl usernames`, listing the accounts (comma-delimited) that may
    access the display. This allows full read/write access.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Enter `<Ctrl> + a` (the default meta key) `chacacl usernames permbits list` to refine permissions if required.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Turn on multi-user mode with `<Ctrl> + a` (the default meta key) `multiuser on`.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- As the viewer, perform the following steps to enable sharing of a single `bash` session among multiple users.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Enter `screen -x <user>/<name>` to connect to a shared screen, e.g., `screen -x host/training`.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Enter `<Ctrl> + a + k` to kill the window and end the session
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- For multi-user mode, `/tmp/screens` must exist and be world-readable and executable.

#### 1.2.21.12. Testing `bash` Script Syntax

- If you are editing a `bash` script and want to ensure your syntax is correct, use the `-n` argument in the `bash`
  command on the script you wish to test the syntax.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ bash -n my_script

  $ echo 'echo "Broken line' >> my_script

  $ bash -n my_script
  my_script: line 4: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'
  my_script: line 5: syntax error: unexpected end of file
  ```

- Ensure you test the `bash` syntax, ideally after every save, and certainly before committing any changes to a version
  control system.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The `-n` option can be tricky to find in the `bash` manpage or other reference materials, because it's located under
  the `set` builtin. It is noted in the `bash --help` for `-D`, but it is not explained.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- As with all syntax checker, `-n` will not catch logic errors or syntax errors in other commands called by the script.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.21.13. Debugging Scripts

- If you can't identify why your script is not operating as you expect, you can add `set -x` to the top of the script
  when you run to turn on `xtrace` for the entire file, or use `set -x` before a troublesome section of your script to
  enable `xtrace` for that troublesome section, allowing you to disable it with `+x`. `xtrace` also works on the
  interactive command line. The `$PS4` prompt could also be updated to enable `xtrace` on the interactive command line.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- For example, the following script could be suspected as being buggy.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  # cookbook filename: buggy
  #

  set -x

  result=$1

  [ $result = 1 ] \
    && { echo "Result is 1; excellent." ; exit 0; } \
    || { echo "Uh-oh, RUN AWAY! " ; exit 120; }
  ```

- Invoking the problematic script, by first exporting the value of `$PS4` prompt. `bash` will print out the value of
  `$PS4` before each command that it displays during an execution trace (i.e., after a `set -x`).
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  ```bash
  $ export PS4='+xtrace $LINENO:'

  $ echo $PS4
  +xtrace $LINENO:

  $ ./buggy
  +xtrace 4: result=
  +xtrace 6: '[' = 1 ']'
  ./buggy: line 6: [: =: unary operator expected
  +xtrace 8: echo 'Uh-oh, RUN AWAY! '
  Uh-oh, RUN AWAY!

  $ ./buggy 1
  +xtrace 4: result=1
  +xtrace 6: '[' 1 = 1 ']'
  +xtrace 7: echo 'Result is 1; excellent.'
  Result is 1; excellent.

  $ ./buggy 2
  +xtrace 4: result=2
  +xtrace 6: '[' 2 = 1 ']'
  +xtrace 8: echo 'Uh-oh, RUN AWAY! '
  Uh-oh, RUN AWAY!

  $ /tmp/jp-test.sh 3
  +xtrace 4: result=3
  +xtrace 6: '[' 3 = 1 ']'
  +xtrace 8: echo 'Uh-oh, RUN AWAY! '
  Uh-oh, RUN AWAY!
  ```

- As of `bash` 3.0, there are a number of new variables to better support debugging: `$BASH_ARGC`, `$BASH_ARGV`,
  `$BASH_SOURCE`, `$BASH_LINENO`, `$BASH_SUBSHELL`, `$BASH_EXECUTION_STRING`, and `$BASH_COMMAND`. There is also a new
  `extdebug` shell option, a new `bash` variable like `$LINENO` and the array variable `$FUNCNAME`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.21.14. Avoid `"command not found"` When Using Functions

- Some programming languages allow you to call a function in a section of your code that comes before the actual
  function definition.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Shell scripts are read and executed in a top-to-bottom linear way, so functions must be defined before they are used.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Some programming languages read through the entire file in its entirety, allowing you to write your code so that
  `main()` is at the top, and functions (or subroutines) are defined lower in the file. In contract, a shell script is
  read into memory and then executed line by line, so you can't use a function before you define it.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

#### 1.2.21.15. Confusing Shell Wildcards & Regular Expressions

- You may see `.*`, or `*`, and sometime `[a-z]*`, but they each have their own special meaning.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Regular expression syntax is only used with the `=~` syntax in `bash`. All of the other expressions in `bash` use
  shell pattern matching.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- The pattern matching used by `bash` uses some of the same symbols as regular expressions, but with different
  meanings. That is also the case that you often have calls in your shell scripts to commands that use regular
  expressions - commands like `grep` and `sed`.
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

- Shell pattern matching is performed by the following:
  [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - File name globbing (path name expansion)
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `==` and `!=` operators for `[[`
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `case` statements
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `$GLOBIGNORE` handling
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `$HISTIGNORE` handling
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `${parameter#[#]word}`
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `${parameter%[%]word}`
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `${parameter/pattern/string}`
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - Several bindable `readline` commands: `glob-expand-word`, `glob-complete-word`, etc.
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `complete -G` and `compgen -G`
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - `complete -X` and `compgen -X`
    [5.9.2. O'Reilly: `bash` Cookbook, 2nd Edition](#592-oreilly-bash-cookbook-2nd-edition)

  - The `help` builtin's `pattern` argument

- There is a list of tips throughout the book, often emphasising points in the accompanying text. The following is the
  list of tips:
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](

  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

#### 1.9.1.2. What's In a Name?

- The first time jargon is used in the book, it is usually defined, or at least a hint is given to its meaning.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Perfectly good jargon is ignored numerous times throughout the book, as the jargon is normally restricted to a
  particular problem domain, or to a particular phase of development.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

### 1.9.2. From the Preface to the First Edition

- Programming is a craft. At its simplest, it comes down to getting a computer to do what you want it to do (or what
  the user wants it to do). As a programmer, you are part listener, part adviser, part interpreter, and part dictator
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- You try to capture elusive requirements and find a way of expressing them so that a mere machine can do them justice.
  You try to document your work so that others can understand it, and you try to engineer your work so that others can
  build on it.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- There are no easy answers. There is no best solution, be it a tool, a language, or an operating system. There can
  only be systems that are more appropriate in a particular set of circumstances.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- You shouldn't be wedded to any particular technology, but have a broad enough background and experience base to allow
  you to choose good solutions in particular situations.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- You adjust your approach to suit the current circumstances and environment. You judge the relative importance of all
  the factors affecting a project and use your experience to produce appropriate solutions. You do this continuously as
  the work progresses.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

#### 1.9.2.1. Who Should Read This Book?

- The book is aimed at people who want to become more effective and more productive programmers. Perhaps you feel
  frustrated you don't seem to be achieving your potential. Perhaps you look at colleagues who seem to be using tools
  to make themselves more producing than you. Maybe your current job uses older technologies, and you want to know how
  newer ideas can be applied to what you do.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

#### 1.9.2.2. What Makes a Pragmatic Programmer?

- Each developer is unique, with individual strengths and weaknesses, preferences and dislikes. Over time, each will
  craft their own personal environment, reflecting the developer's individuality.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- If you're a Pragmatic Programmer, you'll share many of the following characteristics:
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - **Early Adopter/Fast Adapter**:

    - You have an instinct for technologies and techniques, and you love trying things out. When given something new,
      you can grasp it quickly and integrate it with the rest of your knowledge.
      [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
        #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - **Inquisitive**:

    - You tend to ask questions, eager to learn facts, each of which may affect some decision years from now.
      [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
        #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - **Critical Thinker**:

    - You rarely take things as given without first getting the facts.
      [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
        #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - **Realistic**:

    - You try to understand the underlying nature of each problem you face. Deeply understanding that a process
      shouldn't be difficult or will take a while to complete gives you the stamina and confidence to keep at it and
      suggest improvements where appropriate.
      [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
        #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - **Jack of All Trades**:

    - You try hard to be familiar with a broad range of technologies and environments, and you work to keep abreast of
      new developments. Although your current job may require you to be a specialist, you will always be able to move
      on to new areas and new challenges.
      [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
        #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.2.2.1. Tip 1: Care About Your Craft

- There is no point in developing software unless you care about doing it well.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.2.2.2. Tip 2: Think! About Your Work

- Think about what you're doing while you're doing it. An ongoing critical appraisal of every decision you make, every
  day, and on every project is required to truly make a difference to you and your organisation. Never run on
  auto-pilot. Constantly be thing, critiquing your work in real time.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

#### 1.9.2.3. Individual Pragmatists, Large Teams

- Within the overall structure of a project, there is always room for individuality and craftsmanship. This is
  particularly true given the state of software engineering.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

#### 1.9.2.4. It's a Continuous Process

- Every day, work to refine the skills you have and to add new tools to your repertoire.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

### 1.9.3. A Pragmatic Philosophy

#### 1.9.3.1. It's Your Life

- Software development must appear close to the top of any list of carers where you have control. Our skills are in
  demand, our knowledge crosses geographic boundaries, we can work remotely. We're paid well. We really can do just
  about anything we want.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- For some reasons, developers seem to resist change. They hunker down and hope things will get better. They look on,
  passively, as their skills become dated and complain their companies don't train them.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.3.1.1. Tip 3: You Have Agency

- If technology seems to be passing you by, make time (in your own time) to study new material that looks interesting.
  You're investing in yourself, so doing it while you're off the clock is only reasonable.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- The industry give you a remarkable set of opportunities. Be proactive, and take them.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

#### 1.9.3.2. The Cat Ate My Source Code

- Pragmatic Programmers take charge of their own career, and aren't afraid to admit ignorance or error. These things
  happen, and we try to deal with them as professionally as we can. This means being honest and direct. We can be proud
  of our abilities, but we must own up to our own shortcomings - our ignorance and our mistakes.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](

##### 1.9.3.2.1. Team Trust

- Above all, your team needs to be able to trust and rely on you - and you need to be comfortable relying on each of
  them as well.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- In a healthy environment based on trust, you can safely speak your mind, present your ideas, and rely on your team
  members who can in turn rely on you.

##### 1.9.3.2.2. Take Responsibility

- Responsibility is something you actively agree to. You make a commitment to ensure everything is done right, but you
  don't necessarily have direct control over every aspect of it.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- You have the right to not take on a responsibility or an impossible situation, or one in which the risks are too
  great, or the ethical implications too sketchy.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- When you do accept the responsibility for an outcome, you should expect to be held accountable for it. When you make
  a mistake (as we all do) or an error in judgement, admit it honestly, and try to offer options.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Don't blame someone or something else, or make up an excuse. Don't blame all the problems on a vendor, a programming
  language, management, or your coworkers. All of them may play a role, but it is up to you to provide solutions, and
  try to offer options.

##### 1.9.3.2.3. Tip 4: Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses

- Before you approach anyone to tell them why something can't be done, is late, or is broken, stop and listen to
  yourself. Instead of excuses, provide options. Don't say it can't be done: explain what can be done to salvage the
  situation.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Perhaps you need additional resources to complete this task. Don't be afraid to ask for anything to help complete
  your work, or to admit that you need help.

##### 1.9.3.2.4. Challenges (Take Responsibility)

- How do you react when someone comes to you with a lame excuse? What do you think of them and their organisation as a
  result?
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- When you find yourself saving "I don't know", be sure to follow up with with "but I'll find out". It's a great way to
  admit what you don't know, but then take responsibility for finding information like a professional.

#### 1.9.3.3. Software Entropy

- Entropy is a term from physics that refers to the amount of "disorder" in a system.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- When disorder increases in software, we call it "software rot", or more optimistically, "technical debt".
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- There are many factors that can contribute to software rot. The most important seems to be the psychology, or
  culture, at work on a project.

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.3.3.1. Tip 5: Don't Live with Broken Windows

- Don't leave "broken windows" - bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code - unrepaired. Fix each one as soon as it is
  discovered. If there is an insufficient time to fix it properly, then provide a temporary fix. Take some action to
  prevent further damage and to show that you're on top of a situation.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- There are other factors that can contribute to software rot, but neglect accelerates the rot faster than any other
  factor.

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.3.3.2. First, Do No Harm

- One "broken window" - a badly designed piece of code, a poor management decision that the team must live with for the
  duration of the project - is all it takes to start the decline.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- If you start working on a project with quite a few "broken windows". It's all too easy to slip into the mindset of
  "All the rest of this code is crap, I'll just follow suit."
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- In the same token, if you find yourself on a project where the code is immaculate - pristine, cleanly written,
  well-designed, and elegant - you will likely take extract special care not to mess it up. Even if there's pressure on
  make a change, you don't want to be the first one to make a mess and inflict any additional damage to the project.

##### 1.9.3.3.3. Challenges (Software Entropy)

- Help strengthen your team be surveying your project "neighbourhood". Choose two or three "broken windows" and discuss
  the problems - and their possible solution - with your colleagues.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Can you tell when a "window" first gets "broken"? What is your reaction? If it was the result of someone else's
  decision, or a management edict, what can you do about it?

#### 1.9.3.4. Stone Soup & Boiled Frogs

- You may be in a situation where you know exactly what needs doing and how to do it. Ask permission to tackle the
  whole thing and you'll be met with delays and blank stares. People will form committees, budgets will need approval,
  and things will get complicated. Everyone will guard their resources. Sometimes this is called "start-up fatigue."
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Work out what you can reasonably ask for. Develop it well. Once you've got it, show people, and let them marvel. Then
  say it would be better to add minor things, pretending they aren't important. Keep in mind, it's easier to ask
  forgiveness than it is to get permission.

##### 1.9.3.4.1. Tip 6 Be a Catalyst for Change

- You can't force change on people. Instead, show them how the future might be and help them participate in creating it.

#### 1.9.3.5. The Villager's Side

- Projects slowly and inexorably get totally out of hand. Most software disasters start out too small to notice, and
  most project overruns happen a day at a time. It's often the accumulation of small things that breaks morale and
  teams.

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.3.5.1. Tip 7: Remember the Big Picture

- Don't get so engrossed on the details that you forget to check what's happening around you. Keep an eye on the big
  picture. Constantly review what's happening around you, not just what you personally are doing.

##### 1.9.3.5.2. Challenges (The Villager's Side)

- By progressively deceiving your organisation (as outlined in the
  [1.3.3.4. Stone Soup & Boiled Frogs](#1934-stone-soup--boiled-frogs) section), you're doing it harm. Can you determine
  whether you're making the necessary changes for the right reasons or causing unnecessary scope creep? Is the decision
  subjective or objective?
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Get in the habit at looking for anything that seems out of place for your project, such as existing code, practices,
  or requirements.

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

#### 1.9.3.6. Good Enough Software

- The phrase "good enough" does not imply sloppy or poorly produced code. All systems must meet their users'
  requirements to be successful, and meet basic performance, privacy, and security standards. Users should be given the
  opportunity to participate in the process of deciding when what you've produced is good enough for their needs.

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.3.6.1. Involve Your Users in the Trade Off

- Normally software is written for other people. What is required is often asked, but how good it is wanted is rarely
  considered. Sometime there will be no choice.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- The scope and quality of the system you produce should be discussed as part of that system's requirements.

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.3.6.2. Tip 8: Make Quality a Requirements Issue

- Many customers would rather use software with some rough edges today than wait a year for a pristine version,
  especially considering their requirements are likely to change during that year. If you give your users something to
  play with early, their feedback will often lead you to a better eventual solution.

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.3.6.3. Know When to Stop

- Don't spoil a perfectly good program by over-embellishment and over-refinement. Move on, and let your code stand in
  its own right for a while. It may not be perfect, but don't worry, it could never be perfect.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.3.6.4. Challenges (Good Enough Software)

- Look at the software tools and operating systems that you use regularly. Can you find any evidence that these
  organisations and/or developers are comfortable shipping software they know is not perfect?
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Consider the effect of modularisation on the delivery of software. Will it take more or less time to deliver a
  tightly-coupled monolithic block of software to the required quality compared with a system designed as very
  loosely-coupled modules or microservices?
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Can you think of popular software that suffers from feature bloat (more features than you would ever use), each
  feature introducing more opportunity for bugs and security vulnerabilities, and making it harder to use and manage
  the features you do use? Are you in danger of falling into this trap yourself?

#### 1.9.3.7. Your Knowledge Portfolio

- Your knowledge and experience are your most important day-to-day professional assets. Unfortunately, they're expiring
  assets. Your knowledge becomes out of date as new techniques, and environments are developed. As the value of your
  knowledge declines, so does your value to your company or client. We want to prevent this from ever happening.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- A programmer's knowledge portfolio can be considered as all the facts they know about computing, the application
  domains they work in, and their experience. Managing a knowledge portfolio is very similar to managing a financial
  portfolio:

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Managing this kind of investment is a skill just like any other - it can be learned. The trick is to do it initially
  and to format a habit. Develop a routine which you follow until your brain internalises it.

##### 1.9.3.7.1. Building Your Portfolio

- **Invest Regularly**:

  - You must invest in your knowledge portfolio regularly, even if it's just a small amount. Plan to use a consistent
    time and place, away from interruptions.
    [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- **Diversify**:

  - The more different things you know, the more valuable you are. The more technologies you are comfortable with, the
    better you will be able to adjust to change.

      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- **Manage Risk**:

  - Technology exists on a spectrum from risky, potentially high-reward to low-risk, low-reward standards. It's not a
    good idea to invest all your money or skills in one basket.
    [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- **Buy Low, Sell High**:

  - Learning an emerging technology before it becomes popular can be just as hard as finding an undervalued stock, but
    the payoff can be just as rewarding.

      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- **Review & Rebalance**:

  - This is a very dynamic industry. You might spend time learning a technology that ends up dying, or have to re-learn
    a technology you learned and possibly used in the past.

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - **Learn at Least One New Language Every Year**:

    - Different languages solve the same problems in different ways. By learning several different approaches, you can
      help broaden your thinking.

        #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - **Read a Technical Book Each Month**:

    - Browse the booksellers for technical books on interesting topics related to your current project. After you've
      mastered the technologies you're currently using, branch out and study some that don't relate to your project.

        #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - **Read Non-Technical Books, Too**:

    - Don't forget the human side of software development, as that requires an entirely different skill set than
      technical skills.

  - **Take Classes**:

    - Look for interesting courses at a hotel or online college or university, or perhaps at the next nearby trade show
      or conference.

        #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - **Experiment with Different Environments**:

    - Spend some time with Linux if you've only worked on Windows. Use an IDE if you've only used command line tools,
      or vice versa.

        #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Once you feel comfortable with some new language or bit of technology, move on. Learn another one. The
  cross-pollination of ideas is important: try to apply the lessons you've learned to your current project. Even if
  your project doesn't use that technology, perhaps you can borrow some ideas.

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.3.7.4. Critical Thinking

- You need to ensure the knowledge in your portfolio is accurate and unswayed by either vendor or media hype. Beware of

##### 1.9.3.7.5. Tip 10: Critically Analyse What You Read & Hear

- Critical thinking is an entire discipline unto itself. Read and study all you can about it. The following are a few
  questions to ask and think about every time you work on something in future:
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - **Ask the "Five Whys"**:

    - Ask "Why?" at least five times. Ask a question and get an answer. Dig deeper by asking "Why?" You might be able
      to get closer to a root cause this way.
      [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - **Who Does This Benefit?**:

    - Follow the money can be a very helpful path to analyse. The benefits to someone else or another organisation may
      be aligned with your own, or not.
      [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - **What's the Context?**:

    - Everything occurs in its own context, which is why "one size fits all" solutions often don't. Consider an article
      or book touting "best practices." Good questions to ask are "best for who?" What are the prerequisites, what are
      the consequences, short and long term?

      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - **When or Where Would This Work?**:

    - Under what circumstances? Is it too late? Is it too early? Don't stop with thinking what will happen next, think
      about what will happen after that.
      [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- As developers, we have to communicate on many levels. A large part of our day is spend communicating, so we need to
  do it well.

##### 1.9.3.8.1. Tip 11: English is Just Another Language

- Treat your native tongue as just another programming language. Write natural language as you would code: honour the
  DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, the ETC (Easier to Change) principle, automation, etc.

##### 1.9.3.8.2. Know Your Audience

- You're communicating only if you're conveying what you mean to convey - just talking isn't enough. To do that, you
  need to understand the needs, interests, and capabilities of your audience.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- As with all forms of communication, the key is to gather feedback. Don't just wait for questions: ask for them.

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.3.8.3. Know What You Want to Say

- Plan what you want to say. Write an outline. Then ask yourself. "Does this communicate what I want to express to my
  audience in a way that works for them?" If not, refine it until it does.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- When you're faced with an important meeting or a chat with a major client, jot down the ideas you want to
  communicate, and plan a few strategies for getting them across.

##### 1.9.3.8.4. Choose Your Moment

- As part of understanding what your audience needs to hear, you need to work out what their priorities are. Make sure
  what you're saying is relevant in time, as well as in content. Sometime, all it takes is a simple question "Is this a
  good time to talk about...?"
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.3.8.5. Choose a Style

- Adjust the style of your delivery to suit your audience. Determine the style of your delivery based on what they are
  likely to expect or appreciate, or what they've explicitly said they want.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- If you are unable to communicate in the way your audience expects, be sure to provide that feedback. Feedback is also
  a form of communication.

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.3.8.6. Make it Look Good

- Your ideas are important. They ought to look good to convey them to your audience.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Too many developers (and their managers) concentrate solely on content when producing written documents. This is a
  mistake. There is no excuse today for producing poor-looking printed documented. Check the spelling, first
  automatically and then by hand.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.3.8.7. Involve Your Audience

- The documents we produce can often end up being less important than the process we go through to produce them. If
  possible, provide readers with early drafts of your document. Get their feedback, and pick their brains. You'll
    build a good working relationship and produce a better document.

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Encourage people to talk by asking questions, or ask them to restate the discussion in their own words. Turn the
  meeting into a dialogue, and you'll make your point more effectively.

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.3.8.9. Get Back to People

- Always respond to people, even if the response is simple "I'll get back to you later." Keeping people informed makes
  them far more forgiving of the occasional slip, and them feel like you haven't forgotten them.

##### 1.9.3.8.10. Tip 12: It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It

- Unless you work in a vacuum, you need to be able to communicate. The more effective that communication, the more
  influential you become.

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.3.8.11. Communication Through Documentation

- Typically, developers don't give much though to documentation. At best, it is an unfortunate necessity. At work, it
  is treated as a low-priority task that will hopefully be forgotten.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Pragmatic Programmers embrace documentation as an integral part of the overall development process. Writing
  documentation can be made easier by not duplicating effort or wasting time.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.3.8.12. Tip 13: Build Documentation In, Don't Bolt It On

- It's easy to produce good-looking documentation from the comment in source code. Restrict non-API commenting to
  discussing why something is done, it's purpose and goal. The code already shows how it is done, so commenting on this
  is redundant, and a violation of the DRY principle.

##### 1.9.3.8.13. Challenges (Communicate)

- Make a point to read some of the many good books on communications between teams.

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- The next time you have to give a presentation, or write a message advocating some position, try working through the
  advice in this section before you start.

### 1.9.4. A Pragmatic Approach

- There are certain tips and tricks that apply at all levels of software development, processes that are virtually
  universal, and ideas that are almost axiomatic. However, these approaches are rarely documented; you'll mostly find
  them written down as odd sentences in discussions of design, project management, or coding.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

#### 1.9.4.1. The Essence of Good Design

- The world is full of gurus and pundits, all eager to share their hard-earned wisdom when it comes to How to Design
  Software.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.4.1.1. Tip 14: Good Design is Easier to Change Than Bad Design

- A thing is well-designed if it adapts to the people who use it. For code, that means it must adapt by changing.
  Therefore, that means the ETC (Easier to Change) principle is required.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Every design principle out there is a special case of ETC, such as the single responsibility principle, decoupling,
  good naming.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.4.1.2. ETC is a Value, Not a Rule

- Values are things that help you make decisions. When it comes to software, ETC is a guide, helping you choose between
  paths.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- It requires some initial conscious reinforcement. You may ned to spend a week or so deliberately asking yourself when
  you work on things, such as saving a file, writing a test, fixing a bug.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- The ETC principle assumes that a person can tell which of many paths will be easier to change in the future.
  Sometimes, however, you won't have a clue. In those cases, you can do two things:
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - Try to make what you write replaceable. That way, that chunk of code won't be a roadblock. That approach will also
    help keep code decoupled and cohesive.
    [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - Treat the opportunity to develop your instincts. Note the situation, the choices you have, and some guesses about
    change.

      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.4.1.3. Challenges (The Essence of Good Design)

- Consider if a design principle you use regularly makes things easy to change.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Think about languages and programming paradigms (object-oriented, functional programming, reactive, etc.) Do they
  have either major positives or negatives when it comes to helping writing ETC code? Do any have both?
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- When coding, what can you do to eliminate the negatives and accentuate the positives?
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Get your editor to create a prompt when you save a file and use it as a cure to consider the code you wrote. Is it
  easy to change?

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

#### 1.9.4.2. DRY - The Evils of Duplication

- As programmers, we collect, organise, maintain, and harness knowledge. We document knowledge in specifications, we
  make it come alive in running code, and we use it to provide the checks needed during testing.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Unfortunately, knowledge isn't stable. It changes - often rapidly. All this instability means that we spend a large
  part of time in maintenance mode, reorganising and re-expressing the knowledge in our systems.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Programmers are constantly in maintenance mode. Our understanding constantly changes and often our tools, the
  development environment, the people around us, etc. Whatever the reason, maintenance is not a discrete activity, but
  a routine part of the entire development process.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- When we perform maintenance, we have to find and change the representations of things - those capsules of knowledge
  embedded in the application. It is too easy to duplicate knowledge in the specifications, processes, and programs
  that we develop, and when we do so, we invite a maintenance nightmare - one that starts well before the delivery of
  the application.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- The DRY principle: Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a
  system.

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.4.2.1. Tip 15: DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

- If the same thing is expressed in multiple places, and you have to make an update, it isn't a question of whether
  you'll remember to remember every instance, it's a question of when you'll forget.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.4.2.2. DRY is More Than Code

- DRY is about the duplication of knowledge, or intent. It's about expressing the same thing in two difference places,
  possibly in two totally different ways.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.4.2.3. Duplication in Code

- Here's an example of code duplication:
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  ```python
  def print_balance(account)
    printf "Debits: %10.2f\n", account.details
    printf "Credits: %10.2f\n", account.credits

    if account.fees < 0
      printf "Fees: %10.2f-\n", -account.fees
    else
      printf "Fees: %10.2f\n", account.fees
    end

    printf "-------\n"

    if account.balance < 0
      printf "Balance: %10.2f-\n", -account.balance
    else
      printf "Balance: %10.2f\n", account.balance
    end
  ```

###### 1.9.4.2.3.1. Not All Code Duplication is Knowledge Duplication

- The following is not an example of a duplication, as although the code is the same, the knowledge they represent is
  different. The two functions in the example validate two separate things, but just happen to have the same rules.
  That's coincidence, not a duplication.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  ```python
  def validate_age(value):
    validate_type(value, :integer)
    validate_min_inter(value, 0)

  def validate_quantity(value):
    validate_type(value, :integer)
    validate_min_integer(value, 0)
  ```

##### 1.9.4.2.4. Duplication in Documentation

- A comment that explains the functionality in source code is unnecessary duplication. It is almost certain that the
  comment and the code will be inconsistent with each other.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

###### 1.9.4.2.4.1. DRY Violations in Data

- The following data structure represents knowledge, but it can fall afoul of the DRY principle:
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  ```java
  class Line {
    Point start;

    Point end;

    double length;
  }
  ```

- The following code example removes the duplication from the previous code block:
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  ```java
  class Line {
    Point start;

    Point end;

    double length() {
      return start.distanceTo(end);
    }
  }
  ```

- Later in the development process, you may choose to violate the DRY principle for performance reasons. This can occur
  to avoid repeating expensive operations. The trick is to localise the impact. The violation is not exposed outside
  the class containing the violation: only the methods within the class have to worry about keeping things consistent.
  This is illustrated in the following code block:
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  ```java
  class Line {
    private double length;

    private Point start;

    private Point end;

    public Line(Point start, Point end) {
      this.start = start;

      this end = end;

      calculateLength();
    }

    void setStart(Point point) {
      this.start = point;

      calculateLength();
    }

    void setEnd(Point point) {
      this.end = point;

      calculateLength();
    }

    Point getStart() {
      return start;
    }

    Point getEnd() {
      return end;
    }

    double getLength() {
      return length;
    }

    private void calculateLength() {
      this.length = start.distanceTo(end);
    }
  }
  ```

- When a module exposes a data structure, you're coupling all that code that uses that structure to that module's
  implementation. Aim to always use accessor functions to read and write the attributes to objects. It will make it
  easier to add functionality in the future. This can also be seen in the example in the previous code block.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.4.2.5. Representational Duplication

- Your code interfaces to the outside world. Each time the code externally, you introduce some kind of DRY violation:
  your code has to have knowledge that is also present in that external client. It needs to know the API, or the
  schema, or the meaning of error code, etc. Change the information at one end, and the other end breaks. This
  duplication is inevitable, but there are ways to mitigate it.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

###### 1.9.4.2.5.1. Duplication Across Internal APIs

- Look for tools that let you specify the API in some kind of neutral format. These tools will typically generate
  documentation, mock APIs, functional tests, and API clients.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

###### 1.9.4.2.5.2. Duplication Across External APIs

- Public APIs are typically documented formally using something like OpenAPI. This allows you to import the API
  specification into your local API tools and integrate more reliably with the service. Consider creating and
  publishing one if you can't find such a specification.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

###### 1.9.4.2.5.3. Duplication within Data Sources

- Rather than manually creating the code to contain stored data, you can generate the contains from the schema. Many
  persistence frameworks will do the heavy lifting for you.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.4.2.6. Interdeveloper Duplication

- This is perhaps the hardest type of duplication to detect, handle, and mitigate.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Entire sets of functionality may be inadvertently duplicated, and that duplication could go undetected for years,
  leading to maintenance problems.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- At a high level, address the problem by building a strong, tight-knit team with good communication.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- At a module level in code, the problem can be more insidious, commonly needed functionality or data that doesn't fall
  into an obvious area of responsibility can get implemented many times over across a project.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Appoint a team member as the project librarian, whose job is to facilitate the exchange of knowledge in and out of
  the team. Make a point of reading other people's source code and documentation, either informally or during code
  reviews. Use that as an opportunity to learn from them.

##### 1.9.4.2.7. Tip 16: Make It Easy to Rescue

- You are aiming to foster an environment where it's easier to find and reuse existing stuff than to write it yourself.
  If it isn't easy, people won't do it. If you fail to reuse, you risk duplicating knowledge.

#### 1.9.4.3. Orthogonality

- Orthogonality is a critical concept if you want to produce systems that are easy to design, test, and extend.
  Unfortunately, the concept of orthogonality is rarely taught directly, it is often a an implicit feature of various
  other methods and techniques you may learn.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.4.3.1. What is Orthogonality?

- "Orthogonality" is a term borrowed from geometry. Two lines are orthogonal if they meet at right angles. As one line
  moves along the `x` axis, it doesn't change its `y` position. As the other line moves along the `y` axis, it doesn't
  change its `x` position.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- In computing, the term signifies a kind of independency or decoupling. Multiple things are orthogonal if changes in
  one do not affect any of the others. In a well-designed system, the database code will be orthogonal to the user
  interface.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.4.3.2. Benefits of Orthogonality

- Non-orthogonal systems are inherently more complex to change and control. When components of a system are highly
  interdependent, there is no such thing as a local or a small fix.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.4.3.3. Tip 17: Eliminate Effects Between Things

- When components are isolated from one another, you know you can one without having to worry about the rest. As long
  as you don't change that component's external interfaces, you can be confident that you won't have any impacts that
  propagate throughout the entire system.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

###### 1.9.4.3.3.1. Gain Productivity

- **Localised Changes**:

  - It is easier to write relatively small, self-contained components than a single large block of code. Simple
    components can be more easily designed, coded, tested, and then forgotten.
    [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- **Promotes Reuse**:

  - If components have specific, well-defined responsibilities, they can be contained with new components in ways that
    were originally envisioned by the authors of the original components.
    [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- **Increased Code Effectiveness**:

  - Assume that one component does `M` distinct things and another does `N` things. If they are orthogonal and you
    combine then, the result does `M * N` things. You get more functionality per unit of effort by combining orthogonal
    components.
    [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

###### 1.9.4.3.3.2. Reduce Risk

- **Isolated Code**:

  - Segments of code with issues are separate in an orthogonal system from the rest of the system's code, which would
    also be organised orthogonally. Isolated segments of code also make it easier to replace the code without any
    issues.
    [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- **Greater Stability**:

  - The resulting system is less fragile. Make small changes and fixes to a particular area, and any problems you
    generate will be restricted to that area.
    [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- **Better Testing**:

  - The system will most likely be better tested, as it will be easier to design and run tests on its components.
    [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- **Greater Flexibility**:

  - You will not be tied to a particular vendor, product, or platform, as the interfaces to third-party components will
    be isolated to smaller parts of the overall development.
    [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.4.3.4. Design

- Most developers are already familiar with the need to design orthogonal systems, although they may use terms such as
  modular, component-based, and layered to describe the project structure and the process to create software.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- There is an easy test for orthogonal design. Once you have your components mapped out, "If I dramatically change the
  requirements behind a particular function, how many modules are affected?" In an orthogonal system, the answer should
  be one, or as close to one as possible. Moving a button on a GUI panel should not require a change in the database
  schema. Adding context-sensitive help should not change the billing subsystem.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Also ask yourself how decoupled your design is from changes in the real world. Are you using a telephone number as a
  customer identifier? What happens when the company reassigns area code? Postal code, Social Security Numbers, or
  government IDs, email addresses, and domains are all external identifiers that you have no control over, and could
  change at any time for any reason. Don't rely on the properties of things you can't control.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.4.3.5. Toolkits & Libraries

- Be careful to preserve the orthogonality of your system as you introduce third-party toolkits and libraries. Choose
  your technologies wisely. When you bring in a toolkit or library, ask yourself whether it imposes changes on your
  code that shouldn't be there. If an object persistence scheme is transparent, then it's orthogonal. If it required
  you to create or access objects in a special way, then it's not. Keeping such details isolated from your code has the
  additional benefit of making it easier to change vendors in future.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.4.3.6. Coding

- You run the risk of reducing the orthogonality of your application every time you write code. You need to constantly
  monitor the larger context of the application to ensure you do not inadvertently reduce the application's
  orthogonality.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- There are several techniques you can use to main orthogonality:
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - **Keep Your Code Decoupled**:

    - Write shy code - modules that don't reveal anything unnecessary to other modules, and that don't rely on other
      modules' implementations. This way your code remains isolated from the other code's implementation and increases
      the chances you'll remain orthogonal.
      [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
        #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - **Avoid Global Data**:

    - Every time your code references global data, it tiers itself into the other components that share the data.
      [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
        #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

    - Generally, your code is easier to understand and maintain if you explicitly pass any required context into your
      modules.
      [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
        #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

    - The Singleton pattern is a way of ensuring there is only one instance of an object of a particular class. Many
      people use these singleton objects as a kind of global variable. Be careful with singletons - they can lead to
      unnecessary linkage.
      [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
        #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - **Avoid Similar Functions**:

    - You'll often come across a set of functions that all look similar - possibly sharing common code at the start and
      end, but each has a different central algorithm. Duplicate code is symptom of structural problems that can be
      addressed with the Strategy pattern.
      [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
        #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Habitually be critical of your code. Identify and opportunities to reorganise it to refactor the project (to improve
  its structure and orthogonality).
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.4.3.7. Testing

- An orthogonally designed and implemented system is easier to test. More of the testing can be performed at the
  individual module level, as the interactions between the system's components are formalised and limited.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Writing unit tests is a good test of orthogonality. If there's a large amount of setup required to write a unit test,
  then the module being tested is not well decoupled from the rest of the system.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Bug fixing is also a good time to assess a system's orthogonality. When you come across a problem, assess how
  localised the fix is. Do you change just one module, or are the changes scattered throughout the entire system? When
  you make a change, does it fix everything, or do other problems mysteriously arise?
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.4.3.8. Orthogonality Through Documentation

- Orthogonality also applies to documentation. Content and presentation are the focus areas. With truly orthogonal
  documentation, you should be able to change the appearance dramatically without changing the content. Word processors
  provide style sheets and macros to help with that. Markup systems such as Markdown are recommended.

    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

##### 1.9.4.3.9. Living with Orthogonality

- Orthogonality is closely related to the DRY principle. With DRY, you're looking to minimise duplication within a
  system, whereas with orthogonality you reduce the interdependency among the system's components.

###### 1.9.4.3.9.1. Challenges (Living with Orthogonality)

- Consider the difference between tools which gave a GUI and small but combinable command-line utilities used at shell
  prompts. Which set is more orthogonal, and why? Why set is easier to combine with other tools to meet new challenges?
  Which set is easier to learn?
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  using delegation and using inheritance?

###### 1.9.4.3.9.2. Exercises (Living with Orthogonality)

###### 1.9.4.3.9.3. Exercise 1

- **Exercise 1**:

  - You're asked to read a file a line at a time. For each line, you have to split it into fields. Which of the
    following sets of pseudo class definitions is likely to be more orthogonal?
    [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

    - Example A:
      [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
        #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

      ```js
      class SplitA {
        constructor(fileName)   # Splits a line
        def readNextLine()      # Moves to the next line
        def getField(n)         # Returns nth field in current line
      }
      ```

    - Example B:
      [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
        #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

      ```js
      class SplitB {
        constructor(line)     # Splits a line
        def getField(n)       # Returns nth field in current line
      }
      ```

- **Answer 1**:

  - The class `SplitB` is more orthogonal. It only focuses on its own task- - splitting lines - and ignores details
    such as where the lines are coming from. This makes the code easier to develop and makes it more flexible for
    reuse.

      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- **Exercise 2**:

  - What are the differences in orthogonality between object-oriented and functional languages? Are these differences
    inherent in the languages themselves or just in the way people use them?
    [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- **Answer 2**:

  - You can write good, orthogonal code in almost any language.
    [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - Every language has temptations: features that can lead to increased coupling and decreased orthogonality.
    [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - In object-oriented languages, features such as multiple inheritance, exceptions, operator overloading and
    parent-method overriding (via sub-classing) provide many ways of accidentally increasing coupling in non-obvious
    ways. Coupling classes to data is another form of coupling. If you don't make your classes focused enough, it can
    lead to interfaces with too many parameters and/or functions.
    [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
      #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

  - In functional languages, you're encouraged to write lots of small, decoupled functions, and to combine them in
    different ways to solve your problem. This is usually a way of increasing orthogonality, but there is a form of
    coupling that can occur in functional languages. These functions typically transform data, meaning the result of
    one function can become the input to another. If you're not careful, making a change to the data format a function
    generates can result in a failure elsewhere. Languages with good type systems can help mitigate this.

#### 1.9.4.4. Reversibility

- Engineers prefer simple, singular solutions to problems.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- There is always more than one way to implement something. There is usually more than one vendor to provide a
  third-party product. You may be surprised if you are convinced there is only one way to implement or use something.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- As time goes by, and your project progresses, you may find yourself stuck in an untenable position. With every
  critical decision, the project team commits to a smaller target - a narrow version that has fewer options. The
  0problem is that critical decisions aren't reversible.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- Many of the topics in this book are tailored to producing flexible, adaptable software. By sticking to this book's
  recommendations, we don't have to make as many critical, irreversible decisions. This is a good thing, as we don't
  always make the best decisions the first time around. Another source of change is that the requirements, users, and
  hardware change faster than we can get the software developed.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- The mistake in making decisions that will be hard is change comes from the assumption that any decision is cast in
  stone - and in not preparing for the contingencies that might arise. Instead of carving decisions in stone, think of
  them more as being written in the sand at the beach. A big wave can come along and wipe them out at any time.

##### 1.9.4.4.1. Tip 18: There Are No Final Decisions

- While many people try to keep their code flexible, you also need to think about maintaining flexibility in areas of
  architecture, deployment, and vendor integration.
  [5.13.1. The Pragmatic Bookshelf: The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](
    #5131-the-pragmatic-bookshelf-the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)

- You can't plan for architectural volatility, but what you can do is make it easy to change. Hide third-party APIs
  behind your own abstraction layers. Break your code into components; even if you end up deploying them on a single
  server, this approach is a lot easier than splitting a monolithic application.

##### 1.9.4.4.2. Tip 19: Forego Following Fads

- No one knows what the future may hold, especially not us. Enable your code to rock-n-roll: to "rock on" when it can,
  and to "roll with the punches" when it must.

##### 1.9.4.4.3. Challenges (Reversibility)

- Suppose you have a cat in a closed box, along with a radioactive particle. The particle has exactly a 50% change of
  fissioning into two. If it does, the cat will be killed. If it doesn't, the cat will be okay. According to
  Schrödinger, the cat is both dead and alive. Every time a subnuclear reaction takes place that has two possible
  outcomes, the universe is cloned. In one, the event occurred, in the other it didn't. It is only when you open the
  box do you know which universe you are in. Think of code evolution along the same lines as a box full of
  Schrödinger's cats: every decision results in a different version of the future. How many possible futures can your
  code support? Which ones are more likely? How hard would it to be support them when the time comes?

#### 3.1.1.1. Sharding

##### 3.1.1.1.1. What is Database Sharding?

- **Sharding**:

  - A method for distributing a single dataset across multiple databases that can be stored on multiple machines.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

  - Allows for larger databases to be split into smaller chunks and stored in multiple data nodes.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

  - A form of horizontal scaling, as additional nodes are included to share the database load. In contract, vertical
    scaling refers to increasing the power of a single machine or single server through improved hardware or increased
    storage.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

<details open>

<summary>Click to expand/minimise the additional details on database sharding.</summary>

##### 3.1.1.1.2. Do You Need Database Sharding?

- **Vertical Scaling**:

  - Upgrading your database hardware can be a simple solution to improve the performance or storage capacity of your
    database, without the complexity of sharding.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

  - The database architecture or application architecture will not require an update with vertical scaling.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

- **Specialised Services or Databases**:

  - It may make more sense to simply soft a subset of the burden onto other database providers or even a separate
    database.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

  - Offloading a particular functionality can make more sense than trying to shard your entire database.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

- **Replication**:

  - Useful if your data workload is primarily read-focused. Replication increases availability and read performance,
    while avoiding some of the complexity with database sharding.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

  - Read performance can be increased either through load balancing or through geo-located query routing.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

  - Replication increases the workload of write-focused workloads; each write must be copied to every replicated node.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

##### 3.1.1.1.3. Advantages of Sharding

- **Increased Read/Write Throughput**:

  - By distributing the dataset across multiple shards, both read and write operation capacity is increased.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

  - This advantage only applies when the read and write operations are confined to a single shard.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

- **Increased Storage Capacity**:

  - Increasing the number of shards can increase overall storage capacity, allowing near-infinite scalability.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

- **High Availability**:

  - Since each shard is a replica set, every piece of data is replicated.

  - Even if an entire shard becomes unavailable since the data is distributed, the database as a whole still remains
    partly functional, with part of the schema on different shards.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

##### 3.1.1.1.4. Disadvantages of Sharding

- **Query Overhead**:

  - Each sharded database must have a separate machine or service that understands how to route a querying operation to
    the appropriate shard.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

  - This increases latency on each operation.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

  - If the data required for the query is horizontally partitioned across multiple shards, the router must then query
    each shard and merge the result together. This can slow down response times and make simple operations expensive to
    perform.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

- **Complexity of Administration**:

  - A single unsharded database only requires maintenance on the database server itself.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

  - With every sharded database, there are additional service nodes to maintain.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

  - When replication is being used, any data updates must be mirrored across each replicated node.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

- **Increased Infrastructure Costs**:

  - Sharding requires additional machine and additional computing power over a single database server.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

  - Each additional shard comes with higher costs.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

  - The cost of a distributed system can be significant.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

##### 3.1.1.1.5. How Does Sharding Work? These Questions Should Be Answered

- **How the Data Will Be Distributed Across Shards?**:

  - The fundamental question behind any sharded database. The choice will have impacts on both performance and
    maintenance. See [3.1.1.1.6. Sharding Architectures and Types](#31116-sharding-architectures-and-types) for more
    details.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

- **The Type of Queries That Will Be Routed Across Shards**:

  - Replicating data will be highly effective at increasing performance if your workload is primarily read operations.
    Sharding may not be required.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

  - A mixed read-write workload or even a primarily write-based workload with require a different architecture.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

- **How These Shards Will be Maintained?**:

  - In a sharded database, data will need to be periodically redistributed among the various shards. New shards may
    need to be created. This may be an expensive process, depending on how the data is distributed.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

##### 3.1.1.1.6. Sharding Architectures and Types

###### 3.1.1.1.6.1. Ranged/Dynamic Sharding

- Takes a field on the record as an input, and allocated that record to the appropriate shard, based on a predefined
  range. [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

- A lookup table or service is required for all read or writes.
  [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

- A shard key is the field on which the range is based. The choice of the shard key is critical in making range-based
  sharding effective:

  - **Poor Choice**: Will lead to unbalanced shards, leading to decreased performance.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

  - **Effective Choice** Will allow for queries to be targeted to a minimum number of shards.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

- Attributes of an effective shard key:

  - **High Cardinality**: Cardinality is the number of possible values of that key. If a shard key only has three
    possible values, the maximum shard count is three.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

  - **Well-Distributed Frequency**: Frequency is the distribution of the data along the possible values. If 95% of
    records occur with a single shard key value, then 95% of the record will be allocated to a single shard.
    [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

- The lookup service can become a bottleneck, although the amount of data is small enough this is typically not an
  issue.
  [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

###### 3.1.1.1.6.2. Algorithmic/Hashed Sharding

- A record is provided as an inputs, and a hash function or algorithm is applied to that record to generate an output
  or hash value. This output is used to allocate each record to the appropriate shard.
  [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

- The function can take any subset of values on the record as inputs. The following is a simple example.
  [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

  ```text
  Hash Value=ID % Number of Shards
  ```

- Like [3.1.1.1.6.1. Ranged/Dynamic Sharding](#311161-rangeddynamic-sharding) a set of fields determines the allocation
  of the record to a given record. Hashing the inputs allows a more even distribution of shards, even without a
  suitable shard key. No lookup table needs to be maintained.
  [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

- [3.1.1.1.6.1. Ranged/Dynamic Sharding](#311161-rangeddynamic-sharding) reflects the natural structure of the data
  across shards, hashed sharding typically disregards the meaning of the data.
  [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

- Resharding can be expensive. Any update to the number of shards likely requires rebalancing all shards to move around
  records. This is difficult to perform without a system outage.
  [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

###### 3.1.1.1.6.3. Entity-Based/Relationship-Based Sharding

- Data is kept together on a single physical shard. For contrast, related data is often spread across several different
   tables in a relational database.
   [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

- Keeping related data together on the same shard can reduce the need for broadcast operations, increasing performance.
  [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

###### 3.1.1.1.6.4. Geography-Based Sharding/Geosharding

- Like [3.1.1.1.6.3. Entity-Based/Relationship-Based Sharding](#311163-entity-basedrelationship-based-sharding),
  related data is kept together in a single shard. The data is related by geography. This is like
  [3.1.1.1.6.1. Ranged/Dynamic Sharding](#311161-rangeddynamic-sharding) where the shard key contains geographic
  information.
  [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

- If each record contains a `country` in the dataset, overall performance can be increased and system latency can be
  decreased, by storing the appropriate data for that `country` in the relevant shard.
  [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

##### 3.1.1.1.7. Sharding vs Partitioning

- Sharding is a form of partitioning, with an emphasis on locating each shard in a separate physical node.
  [5.6.1. Mongodb: Database Sharding](#561-mongodb-database-sharding)

- Partitions can co-exist on a single machine.

## 3.2. Inter-Service Communication

### 3.2.1. Security

#### 3.2.1.1. Service Mesh

##### 3.2.1.1.1. Service Mesh Overview

- **Service Mesh**:

  - A service mesh is configurable, low-latency infrastructure layer designed to handle a high volume of network-based
    interprocess communication among application infrastructure services using APIs.
    [5.7.1. Nginx: What Is A Service Mesh?](#571-nginx-what-is-a-service-mesh)

  - It ensures that communication among containerised and often ephemeral application infrastructure services is fast,
    reliable, and secure.
    [5.7.1. Nginx: What Is A Service Mesh?](#571-nginx-what-is-a-service-mesh)

<details open>

<summary>Click to expand/minimise the additional details on service meshes.</summary>

- **Sidecar**:

  - Used for each service instance implement a service mesh, by providing a proxy interface.
    [5.7.1. Nginx: What Is A Service Mesh?](#571-nginx-what-is-a-service-mesh)

  - Handles anything that can be abstracted away from the individual services, e.g., inter-service communications,
    monitoring, and security-related concerns.
    [5.7.1. Nginx: What Is A Service Mesh?](#571-nginx-what-is-a-service-mesh)

  - Operations teams can maintain the service mesh and run the application, allowing the development teams to handle
    development, support, and maintenance for the service application code.
    [5.7.1. Nginx: What Is A Service Mesh?](#571-nginx-what-is-a-service-mesh)

- It provides the following component services and functions:

  ![Diagram](https://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/service-mesh-generic-topology.png)

  - **Container Orchestration Framework**:

    - A separate tool for managing the set of containers in an application's infrastructure.
      [5.7.1. Nginx: What Is A Service Mesh?](#571-nginx-what-is-a-service-mesh)

    - Kubernetes is the most common example.
      [5.7.1. Nginx: What Is A Service Mesh?](#571-nginx-what-is-a-service-mesh)

  the cluster.
  [5.5.1. Microsoft: About Service Meshes](#551-microsoft-about-service-meshes)

- **Traffic Management and Manipulation**: Create a policy on a service that will rate limit all traffic to a version
  of a service from a specific origin, or a policy that applies a retry strategy to classes of failures between
  specified services.
  [5.5.1. Microsoft: About Service Meshes](#551-microsoft-about-service-meshes)

- **Observability**: Gain insight into how your services are connected and the traffic that flows between them.
  [5.5.1. Microsoft: About Service Meshes](#551-microsoft-about-service-meshes)

##### 3.2.1.1.3. Selection Criteria for Installing a Service Mesh

- **Is an Ingress Controller Sufficient For My Needs?** Traffic splitting at the ingress may be sufficient to support
  the required scenario. Don't add complexity to your environment with no benefit.
  [5.5.1. Microsoft: About Service Meshes](#551-microsoft-about-service-meshes)

- **Can My Workloads and Environment Tolerate the Additional Overheads?** All the additional components required to
  support the service mesh require additional resources like CPU and memory.
  [5.5.1. Microsoft: About Service Meshes](#551-microsoft-about-service-meshes)

- **Is this Adding Additional Complexity Unnecessarily?** If the reason for installing a service mesh is to gain a
  capability that is not business-critical, then consider whether the additional complexity is worth it.
  [5.5.1. Microsoft: About Service Meshes](#551-microsoft-about-service-meshes)

- **Can this be Adopted in an Incremental Approach?** Some of the service meshes that provide a lot of capabilities can
  be adopted in a more incremental approach. Install just the components you need to ensure your success.

#### 3.2.1.2. TLS

##### 3.2.1.2.1. TLS Overview

- **TLS**:

  - TLS: Transport Layer Security
    [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

  - A security protocol that is used to establish encrypted between a web server and a browser to protect the data
    exchanged between them.
    [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

  - The successor of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
    [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

  - Now the most widely-used protocol for securing web communications.
    [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

  - TLS ensures that data cannot be read or tampered with during transit and that the identity of the communicating
    parties can be verified.
    [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

<details open>

<summary>Click to expand/minimise the additional details on TLS.</summary>

##### 3.2.1.2.2. How TLS Works

- TLS uses a combination of public-key cryptography and symmetric-key cryptography to achieve its security goals:

  - **Public-Key Cryptography**:

    - Aka, asymmetric cryptography.
      [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

    - Relies on a pair of keys to decrypt data; a public key and a private key.
      [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

      - The public key can be shared with anyone.
        [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

      - The private key must be kept secret.
        [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

  - **Symmetric-Key Cryptography**:

    - Uses a single shared key to encrypt and decrypt data.
      [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

    - **Advantage**: Much faster than public-key cryptography.
      [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

    - **Disadvantage**: Both parties must securely share the secret key before they can communicate securely.
      [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

- When two parties want to establish a secure connection using TLS, they first use public-key cryptography to agree on
  a shared secret key. They can then use symmetric-key cryptography for all further communications using that shared
  secret key. This allows TLS to take advantage of the speed of symmetric-key cryptography, while ensuring the shared
  secret key remains confidential. The shared secret key never needs to be transmitted over the network. It can be
  generated from within each party's own computer.
  [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

##### 3.2.1.2.3. SSL vs TLS

- SSL was initially developed to secure sensitive information, e.g, credit card numbers and passwords, as it is passed
  around the internet.
  [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

- TLS is based on SSL, but includes a number of security enhancements making it more effective at protecting data.
  [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

- TLS provides stronger authentication than SSL, by verifying the identity of the server (like SSL) and the client.
  This two-way authentication helps prevent "man-in-the-middle" attacks; when an attacker intercepts communications
  between a server and a client to impersonate both parties.
  [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

- TLS also offers Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS). If an attacker is able to compromise a private key, they would only be
  able to access data that was encrypted with that key. PFS is achieved by using the Diffie-Hellman exchange to
  generate unique keys for each session.
  [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

##### 3.2.1.2.4. How Does TLS Affect Web Application Performance?

###### 3.2.1.2.4.1. TLS Handshake Protocol

- One of the most common ways that TLS affects web application performance.
  [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

- The TLS handshake occurs when two devices first establish a secure communication channel.
  [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

- During the handshake, the devices exchange information about their preferred security protocols and cipher suites.
  This adds significant overhead to web applications, especially if the handshake is renegotiated frequently.
  [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

###### 3.2.1.2.4.2. Cipher Suites

- **Cipher Suites**: Algorithms used to encrypt communication between two devices.
  [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

- Some cipher suites are more resource-intensive than others, which can impact the performance of web applications.
  [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

##### 3.2.1.2.5. Mitigating the Negative Effects of TLS on Web Application Performance

- **Prioritise Performance Over Security**:

  - Use only the encryption algorithms and key sizes that are absolutely necessary to maintain an acceptable level of
    security.
    [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

  - 128-bit is sufficient for most applications.
    [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

- **Offload Cryptographic Processing**:

  - Use hardware accelerators or specialised processors to offload the cryptographic processing required for TLS from
    the main CPU.
    [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

  - Can free up valuable CPU resources for other tasks and improve overall system performance.
    [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

- **Use Connection Pooling**:

  - Connection pooling allows multiple clients to reuse a small number of pre-opened connections.
    [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

  - Reduces the overhead from opening and closing connections, improving both throughput and latency.
    [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

- **Cache Session IDs**:

  - Session IDs can be cached locally to avoid the overhead of performing a full handshake each time a new session is
    needed.
    [5.12.1. Techradar: What is TLS and How Does it Work?](#5121-techradar-what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work)

  - Most effective for short-lived sessions that are reused frequently.

## 3.4. Telecommunications

### 3.4.1. Network Slicing

#### 3.4.1.1. What is Network Slicing?

- An operators' best answer on how to build and manage a network, that meets and exceeds the emerging requirements from
  a wide range of users.
  [5.1.1. Ericsson: Navigate the Network Slicing Transformation Journey](
    #511-ericsson-navigate-the-network-slicing-transformation-journey)

- The way to achieve a sliced network is to transform it into a set of logical networks on top of a shared
  infrastructure. Each logical network is designed to serve a defined business purpose and comprises of all the
  required network resources, configured and connected end-to-end.
  [5.1.1. Ericsson: Navigate the Network Slicing Transformation Journey](
    #511-ericsson-navigate-the-network-slicing-transformation-journey)

- The network slice is a logically separated, self-contained, independent and secured part of the network, targeting
  different services with different requirements on speed, latency and reliability. Network slice characteristics
  include low latency, high bandwidth and ultra-reliability for a critical IoT use case or higher latency and lower
  bandwidth for a massive IoT use case.
  [5.1.1. Ericsson: Navigate the Network Slicing Transformation Journey](
    #511-ericsson-navigate-the-network-slicing-transformation-journey)

- To efficiently manage the network slices and to maximise revenues, a modern OSS/BSS
  (Business and Operations Support Systems) providing automated business and operational processes is a must. With
  programmable and flexible 5G networks and advanced AI (Artificial Intelligence) and Service Level Agreement (SLA)
  driven orchestration, the required network functions can be flexibly created, quickly deployed and automatically
  managed throughout the life cycle.
  [5.1.1. Ericsson: Navigate the Network Slicing Transformation Journey](
    #511-ericsson-navigate-the-network-slicing-transformation-journey)

- A network slice can be dedicated to one enterprise customer, or shared by multiple tenants. For example, a slice may
  consist of dedicated radio, transport and core resources including a dedicated user plane function at the edge.
  Another slice shares radio & transport resources between tenants, but provides dedicated core network functions per
  tenant.

#### 3.4.1.2. Benefits of Network Slicing

- End-to-end network slicing enables new business model innovation and use cases across all verticals, and creates new
  revenue opportunities for communication service providers. It provides service flexibility and ability to deliver
  services faster with high security, isolation, and applicable characteristics to meet the contracted SLA.
  [5.1.1. Ericsson: Navigate the Network Slicing Transformation Journey](
    #511-ericsson-navigate-the-network-slicing-transformation-journey)

- Network Slicing enables operators to maximise the return on investment via efficient usage and management of the
  network resources and provide differentiated services at scale.
  [5.1.1. Ericsson: Navigate the Network Slicing Transformation Journey](
    #511-ericsson-navigate-the-network-slicing-transformation-journey)

- As 5G brings new technologies and creates new business opportunities across all industries, enterprises are looking
  for innovative solutions to meet their needs and to address new opportunities. Enterprise users want automated
  business and operational processes starting from ordering the service, activation, delivery and de-commissioning of
  the service. They are expecting services to be delivered faster with high security. With network slicing,
  communication service providers can meet all the needs from their enterprise customers.

#### 3.4.1.3. How 5G Network Slicing Works

![How 5G Network Slicing Works](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/networking-slicing_diagram.png)

#### 3.4.1.4. Network Slicing Use Cases

- Network slicing supports use cases that focus on performance, capacity and security. Many use cases involve the
  business models based on the Internet of Things. Some network slicing use cases involve the following:
  [5.11.1. Tech Target: Network Slicing](#5111-tech-target-network-slicing)

  - **Real-Time Performance**:

    - A company depending on a 5G network for autonomous vehicle management might contract for a mobile network slice
      with latencies under 5 ms and stringent guarantees of packet delivery on the minimum throughput required to
      ensure responsive control.
      [5.11.1. Tech Target: Network Slicing](#5111-tech-target-network-slicing)

    - The provider would use URLLC (UltraReliable Low-Latency Communications) functionality to guarantee the slice on
      the lowest-latency equipment and paths between vehicles and cloud or edge resources and reserve enough capacity
      to meet the throughput target.
      [5.11.1. Tech Target: Network Slicing](#5111-tech-target-network-slicing)

  - **Capacity**:

    - For a security monitoring system in a large auditorium, latency may not matter, but the security company may want
      to buy guaranteed delivery of the camera data.
      [5.11.1. Tech Target: Network Slicing](#5111-tech-target-network-slicing)

    - In other words, the company would want its traffic to get 1.5 megabits per second of throughput per camera with
      no packets dropped, ever.
      [5.11.1. Tech Target: Network Slicing](#5111-tech-target-network-slicing)

    - The provider might aggregate multiple connectivity and processing device options to meet the needs of this slice.
      [5.11.1. Tech Target: Network Slicing](#5111-tech-target-network-slicing)

  - **Security**:

    - For a human health monitoring system in a metropolitan area, a hospital might want to isolate all traffic to and
      from pacemakers.
      [5.11.1. Tech Target: Network Slicing](#5111-tech-target-network-slicing)

    - This would minimise the risk of a leak of customer data and the threat of compromise of the control channel - so
      it would require a slice with single-user virtual resources.
